## Abstract

Purpose : The  present  work  sought  to  analyze  the  level  of  compliance  of  the  Brazilian companies in the telecommunications sector listed in B3 to accounting pronouncement CPC 47.

Methodology :  A  checklist  was  elaborated  containing  8  (eight)  criteria  in  which  companies should disclose in order to obtain a high level of compliance with CPC 47. It's characterized as a  documentary  research  with  analysis  of  content  over  the  consolidated  financial  statements (balance sheet and income statement), explanatory notes and management reports published by the companies in the years 2017 and 2018.

Results :  The  results  show  that  no  company  presented  adherence  to  the  new  standard.  The company Telefonica Vivo Brazil was the one with the highest level, 56.25%, while Telebras presented  the  lowest,  29.16%.  In  addition,  it  was  checked  whether  the  companies  already disclosed their information in accordance with the standard before it became mandatory, as a voluntary disclosure. The companies OI S.A., Telebras and Algar Telecom did not mention CPC 47 in the first three quarters of 2017. On the other hand, Telefonica Vivo Brazil and TIM Holdings alluded to the norm since the first period analyzed.

Contributions of the Study : It's a current topic in accounting research because it's the year of implementation of CPC 47, and relevant, as it will bring significant changes in the recognition and disclosure criteria of revenues. From the literature review, few studies have been done dealing with the topic. From this, this research sought to contribute to expand the list of works produced on the new CPC, with a quantitative approach, in the lines of accounting disclosure and regulation.

Keywords : CPC 47, adherence, compliance, telecommunications.

## 1 Introduction

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) recently issued IFRS 15, which provides for the recognition of revenue from customer contracts, corresponding to accounting pronouncement CPC 47 in Brazil. The purpose of these standards is to establish principles that entities should  apply  in  order  for  financial  information  to  be  useful  and  capable  of demonstrating  the  nature,  amount,  timing,  and  uncertainties  inherent  in  the  recognition  of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a financial institution. client. For Mota, Campos,

Niyama and Paulo (2012), the publication of this new standard is due to differences in the revenue recognition process between IASB and FASB - Financial Accounting Standards Board. Therefore,  for  the  authors,  this  norm  arose  to  harmonize  and  promote  greater  convergence between the normative of the two organs.

However,  Cova  (2016)  reports  that  the  advent  of  the  new  standard  produced  some apprehension, given that the new requirements would affect companies in different ways in their business, such as changes in the characteristics and models of contracts, changes in the moment of revenue recognition. , in the control systems and internal processes, compliance with debt clauses and in the variable remuneration program of the employees, which would significantly impact the companies' results and performance indicators (KPMG, 2014), to the point  of  their  effective  introduction  being  postponed.  January  2017  to  January  2018,  with retroactive application since 2016.

The one-year postponement for the application of the new standard was relevant, given that  companies had a transition period to establish an appropriate adoption schedule and to manage the entire process. Therefore, it is expected that upon effective adoption, companies will be able to fully adhere to IFRS 15 and CPC 47 (Cova, 2016).

In Brazil, companies sought to adapt to meet the requirements of the new CPC issued, effective from the same date as the international standard, affecting various economic sectors due to the change in revenue recognition, notably those related to the provision of services, such as construction, telecommunications, transportation, among others (Silva, 2018).

According to Beckman and Koczan (2006), revenue recognition has been a major issue in  the  international  accounting  environment  among  companies,  regulators  and  users,  as companies are often required to republish their statements due to inconsistency in accounting for revenues. Thus, the economic and financial information will only be useful to users' decision making if the transactions  are  measured,  recognized  and  evidenced  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the standard.

Thus,  disclosure  becomes  a  very  important  tool,  as  it  is  the  way  the  company communicates with stakeholders. Backes, Ott and Wiethaeuper (2005) affirm that disclosure is one of the main goals of accounting, whose function is to transmit useful information for users' decision  making.  Disclosure  is  fundamental  to  reduce  the  informational  asymmetry  in  the capital market between managers and investors, making the principal aware of the business risks assumed by agents (Sousa, Mapurunga, &amp; Ponte, 2014).

In this regard, there are several studies that investigate the benefits of better accounting disclosure. It is worth mentioning Verrecchia (2001), which subdivides the theory of disclosure into three classes: (a) Association-based disclosure, which investigates the behavior of investors based on the information disclosure event; (b) Discretionary-based disclosure, which seeks to investigate  why  entities  disclose  certain  information;  and  (c)  Efficiency-based  disclosure, which investigates the most widely accepted types of disclosure to inform users' decisions.

Given the context presented, the following research question emerges: what is the level of adherence to CPC 47 of companies listed in B3 belonging to the telecommunications sector? The  general  objective  being  set  is  to  verify  whether  such  companies  are  broadly compliant  with  the  new  accounting  pronouncement,  given  the  mandatory  environment  for disclosing the information they contain.

Lima, Fonseca and Brito (2009) emphasize that full disclosure should not be limited to the aspects required by law, and should add other information that may be useful for business decision making. In this sense, we distinguish between mandatory disclosure and voluntary disclosure. Teixeira (2010) emphasizes that companies that value voluntary disclosure as a way to  differentiate  themselves  within  the  capital  market  are  presented  as  more  interesting

investment  alternatives.  On  the  other  hand,  Yamamoto  and  Salotti  (2006)  understand  that voluntary  disclosure  is  not  always  advantageous,  since  disclosure  of  information  incurs preparation costs, always considering the production costs and benefits of voluntary disclosure. Dye  (2001)  summarizes  this  debate,  mentioning  that  voluntary  disclosure  is  a  choice  of companies and should be used if, and only if, it brings gains in some way to the entity.

In this context, as an additional analysis, this research will try to verify, in light of the Voluntary  Disclosure  Theory,  if  the  companies  object  of  study  already  showed  their information according to CPC 47, during the transition period, when the standard was not yet mandatory. .

The choice of the telecommunications sector is justified for two reasons. The first is for its  importance.  Data  from  the  2018  Report  of  Telebrasil  -  Brazilian  Telecommunications Association - show that the services of the sector reached around 323.7 million subscribers and produced Gross Operating Revenue of R $ 117.8 billion in the first half of 2018, representing 3.5 % of GDP so far. This amount represents an increase of 0.2% over the same period of 2017. In addition, the sector employs 483.4 thousand people and the combined market value of the component companies recorded a value of R $ 110 billion in the first half of 2018. The second reason that justifies the choice of the sector is based on the analysis of the KPMG (2014) report, which mentions this as one of the sectors that could be most affected by the rule changes in the recognition and disclosure with customer contracts.

In this sense, the research is justified and relevant because it seeks to verify whether companies are presenting information  in  line  with  the  standard,  freeing  organizations  from problems with regulators and making the information useful to the user. It also contributes to presenting a metric to verify the level of disclosure, which can be replicated for other research. In addition, there were few studies that explored the aspects of the standard, since its obligation is recent. Thus, it is expected that the study will contribute to the literature about accounting disclosure and regulation.

## 2 Background

## 2.1 Standardization of Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Until  2014,  the  IASB  issued  several  standards  that  addressed  matters  related  to  the identification, recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure  of  revenues,  such  as  IAS  11Construction Contracts, IAS 18- Revenue, IFRIC 13- Loyalty Program, IFRIC 15- Construction Contracts. real estate sector, IFRIC 18 - Receipt in transfer of client assets and, finally, SIC-31 - Exchange Transaction involving advertising services. However, as reported by Oncioiu and Tãnase (2016), such regulations presented difficulties in accounting for multi-element sales contracts.

For  Falcão,  Niyama  and  Pinto  (2014),  the  standardization  of  the  recipe  brought complexity to its application and some important themes, such as the recognition of recipes for several  items  in  the  same  arrangement,  were  limited.  The  absence  of  robust  guidelines, according  to  Oncioiu  and  Tãnase  (2016),  made  preparers  perform  different  accounting  for similar transactions. In this sense, it was necessary to develop and improve a single approach.

In line with the regulatory improvements promoted and developed by the IASB, a joint project  was  initiated  with  the  FASB  to  develop  a  single  standard  for  customer  revenue recognition, culminating in the publication on May 28, 2014 by IFRS 15. IASB and ASC 606 by the FASB. Such regulations were considered as great achievements for regulatory agencies, as in general the hitherto existing standard was undermined due to the lack of sufficient detail

on recognition requirements (Cova, 2016). In addition, the joint publication of the standards represents a historical landmark in world accounting, as it shows effective signs of convergence between international standards issued by the IASB and North American standards issued by the FASB (Tavares, 2016).

For the assimilation of the principles of IFRS 15, companies will have to carry out a thorough analysis of their contracts in order to correctly fit in with the imposition of the new standard.  From  a  broader  perspective,  the  various  stakeholders  will  need  to  understand  the impact that the new standard will have on the company's operations in order to support their assessments and forecasts. In addition, it may impact numerous dimensions of the corporate environment, such as control, to ensure ongoing compliance with the standard, information technology, to ensure secure accounting for transactions, and tax management, to proceed with tax strategies to the best tax planning (Cova, 2016).

For McConnell (2014), the relevant changes brought by IFRS 15 depend on the sector in which companies operate, and the assessment of the actual impacts of adopting this standard will depend, in particular, on each company, especially at the exact moment when revenue will be recognized.

Rutledge, Karin and Kim (2016) consider that the new standard should contribute to greater  consistency  in  revenue  recognition  and  presentation.  However,  a  single  accounting principle-based model will require the preparers of the financial statements to use additional professional judgment in measuring corporate performance obligations and in meeting those obligations. In addition, the new recognition standard requires enhanced disclosures, which are quantitatively higher than previously required, which will increase the cost of disclosure. Still, for the authors, the success of the new revenue recognition standard is that all companies will be  required  to  disclose  their  judgments  used  in  determining  the  timing  and  values  of  a transaction price allocated to performance obligations.

According to Silva (2018), the standard aims to create a unique model for recognizing customer contracts, providing better comparability of financial statements, which, according to the Conceptual Framework, is one of the qualitative characteristics of improving accounting information.

Regarding Brazil, according to Niyama, Cavalcante and Rezende (2010), the flexibility provided in the revenue recognition hitherto established in CPC 30, as well as the particularities of each contract result in distinct practical applications for the same transaction. In order for companies to adapt to the new standards, CPC 47 - Customer Contract Revenue - in accordance with IFRS 15 was approved in November 2016.

Bodies such as the Federal Accounting Council (CFC), through NBC TG 47 and the Brazilian  Securities  Commission  (CVM),  through  Resolution  762/16,  approved  and  made Accounting Pronouncement 47 mandatory for publicly traded Brazilian companies.

## 2.2  Impacts  of  the  adoption  of  Accounting  Pronouncement  CPC  47  and  disclosure  of accounting information

According to CPC 47, for contract identification, companies must analyze the rights and obligations that are required. The customer agreement must meet the following criteria to be properly recognized: (i) the parties must approve the agreement, either in writing, verbally or in accordance with other customary business practices, and are committed to fulfilling their respective obligations; (ii) when the rights of each party with respect to the goods and services to be transferred can be identified; (iii) when the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred can be identified; (iv) when the contract has commercial substance, eg, the economic

risks and benefits at the time are expected to change as a result of the contract; and (v) when it is  probable  that  the  company  will  receive  the  consideration  to  which  it  will  be  entitled  in exchange  for  the  goods  and  services  transferred  to  the  customer.  The  amount  of  the consideration, inclusive, may be lower than the price stated in the contract.

Revenue  must  go  all  the  way  previously  described  before  it  can  be  recognized. Moreover,  the  points  regarding  measurement  and  disclosure  must  also  be  obeyed,  as  well, according to Silva (2018), the tax legislation must be verified, so that the tax planning is carried out in the best way.

Given this new approach promoted by CPC 47, according to a report by KPMG (2014), certain companies may suffer significant impacts on their results, especially those in the service sector,  such  as  construction,  telecommunications,  transportation,  technology,  among  others. others. From this perspective, Silva (2018) warns that, due to changes in revenue recognition, companies will need to assess the nature of their obligations and make a detailed review of their contractual aspects, as one thing can significantly impact the other, while observe the legal aspects.

In this sense, also in Silva (2018), revenue recognition can be accelerated or deferred for transactions with multiple elements, variable consideration values or licenses, which can directly affect financial indicators, widely used in fundamentalist analysis, which say a lot to respect of the entity's performance, which affects the restrictive clauses for compliance with covenants, naturally affecting the availability of profit for distribution to shareholders and staff, as  well  as  the  tax  policy  and  even  the  compliance  schedule  company  goals,  which  in  turn directly affect employees who are entitled to this type of compensation (commissions).

Still  regarding  the  impacts,  according  to  the  same  report  of  KPMG  (2014),  the companies' suitability to CPC 47 may mean several actions in the entity's operational structure, such as implementation of new systems, new process management structure, which may require staff training, hiring new employees and dismissing others. It is also important to note that CPC 47 allows a retrospective application for the transition period, and may be full, in which said technical pronouncement is applied for all periods presented, as if all customer contracts in force on the date of disclosure of the information. had been constructed in light of that standard, or  a  modified  adoption,  that  is,  the  companies  will  present  their  accounting  and  financial information in accordance with the new standard only for the last period of publication.

The literature is also unanimous about the disruption that the new CPC will promote about corporate accounting information. Tavares, Anjos and Paulo (2014) argue that there are strong complaints from companies regarding the detailing of the information required by the new standard, especially in the aspects related to disclosure. Souza and Souza (2015) show that there  will  be  a  significant  increase  in  complexity  in  the  analysis  of  contract  elements  to recognize revenue. Cova (2016) and Severiano, Alencar and Garcia (2017) comment that this regulatory innovation will bring several challenges and impacts for companies and, therefore, the implementation process would be laborious and costly, so it would be prudent to act timely towards of already adapting to the new reality. Finally, Silva (2018) states that the main impacts of adoption will be on key indicators and metrics, which involve the value of revenues and their origin, as well as the possible reallocation of part of revenues in other income items.

Given  all  this  conjuncture,  when  observing  the  structural  aspects  of  this  norm  and imminent impacts, the adequacy of information by companies, besides being mandatory, makes the  disclosure  process  more  transparent  and  makes  users  aware  of  the  recognition  process. revenue,  especially  if  it  is  being  carried  out  as  planned,  which  helps  the  decision-making process.

According to Healy and Palepu (2001), disclosure is the result of both the process of providing the largest amount of information to stakeholders and the mandatory disclosure, in order to comply with current legislation. Verrecchia (2001) mentions that disclosure plays a relevant role in the functioning of markets, as it contributes to the reduction of information asymmetry, enables an increase in the amount of business and contributes to the reduction of the  cost  of  capital  of  companies.  In  addition,  qualitative  accounting  information  allows reliability and comparability, precisely because it conveys relevance (Quinteiro, &amp; Medeiros, 2005; Oliveira, 2016).

Disclosure is one of the three pillars of accounting. The CVM states that Accounting is an  information  system  designed  to  provide  stakeholders  with  economic,  financial  and productivity statements and analyzes with respect to the entity (CVM, 1986).

For a company to achieve greater levels of transparency, it must disclose qualitative and quantitative  information  that  enables  stakeholders  to  reliably  assess  the  present  economic situation and make inferences for the future (Dantas, Zendersky, &amp; Niyama, 2004).

Lanzana (2004) and Oliveira (2016), mention that, from the point of view of legitimacy, some companies are more interested in disclosing their information than others, because in this way, they become more legitimate for the investor market, even more than, According to Arbel and Strebel (1982), investors only invest resources in what they know, and the more one knows, the less informational asymmetry between principal and agent.

Thus arises what is called voluntary disclosure. It is the level of additional disclosure, more than the obligatory and self-made. By acting in this way, stakeholders would show more interest  in  this  type  of  company  (Rodrigues,  2014).  This  has  become  a  lucrative  market: companies  interested  in  enhancing  their  reputation,  enhancing  their  image  and  thereby attracting  more  investors  have  incorporated  in  their  business  strategy  the  art  of  voluntary disclosure of relevant information in user decision making (Oliveira, 2016 ).

Dye (2001) warns of the omission of relevant variables in the disclosure process. He believes that this may lead to negative inferences about the organization and may impact the credibility of the information disclosed. Therefore, it should be emphasized that the company must  be  committed  to  the  complete  and  voluntary  disclosure  of  socio-economic  and  even environmental  information,  as  a  way  of  legitimizing  its  actions  and  raising  gains  for  the institutional image.

Thus, it is clear that voluntary disclosure can represent a differential to guide decisions of the various stakeholders, since this level of disclosure increases the informational quality of the  financial  statements  and  the  environment  in  which  organizations  are  inserted  (Oliveira, 2016).

## 3 Methodology

## 3.1 Search Type

The research is divided into two moments. In the first, it presents a literature review, which  seeks,  according  to  Tickim,  Amaro  and  Moreira  (2010),  to  present,  briefly  and comprehensively,  previous  studies  that  dealt  with  the  research  theme  and  problematic,  the contextualization and by which authors. the topic in question has already been addressed.

It  has  a  qualitative  nature  throughout  the  documentary  analysis  performed  with  the accounting information of the companies studied. Malhotra, Kim and Patil (2006, p. 154) state that  "qualitative  research  provides  better  insight  and  understanding  of  the  context  of  the problem." The research is also descriptive, as it describes the characteristics for accounting

recognition  of  Customer  Contract  Revenue,  considering  the  new  Technical  Pronouncement issued - CPC 47. According to Gil (2002), this type of research describes characteristics and evidences of a given sample and still establishes relationships between variables.

Secondly, statistical  tools  were  used  to  assess  the  adherence  level  of  the  companies studied to CPC 47, based on a metric used in the research by Gonçalves (2011) and Oliveira, Gonçalves, Medeiros and Fernandes (2018). For Diehl and Tatim (2004), researches of this type seek to present results with greater reliability margin, as they reduce possible distortions in analysis and interpretation.

## 3.2 Study object

The object of this research is the telecommunications sector companies listed in B3, namely: Algar Telecom S/A, OI S/A, Brazilian Telecommunications - Telebras S/A, Telefonica Vivo Brazil S/A and Tim Holdings S/A. It is noteworthy that the company Telemar Norte Leste S/A is listed on the Stock Exchange, however, it belongs to the OI S/A group, and its financial statements and financial statements are presented to the parent company and are not individually reviewed in this study.

The timeframe is the first three quarters of 2018, the year accounting pronouncement 47 became effective for listed Brazilian companies. The information for the fourth quarter of 2018 was not analyzed, since at the time of writing this information had not been published.

In addition, the 2014 KPMG report mentioned that the adoption of IFRS 15 could be anticipated, but not expected. Therefore, the 2017 accounting information was also analyzed. This verification is also justified by Dye (2001), who argues that the organization will disclose information on a voluntary basis if and only if it is positive for its image and appreciation.

## 3.3 CPC 47 Compliance Level Analysis Metric

The objective of this study was the Accounting Pronouncement Level CPC 47, which aims to measure the level of compliance of the companies studied with the application of the new  CPC,  evaluated  from  the  perspective  of  recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure  for Revenue with customers.

To  reach  the  index,  a  checklist  was  assembled  with  information  gathered  from  the KPMG report (2014) and Silva's research (2018). For both studies, entities may have high costs with the implementation and adequacy of CPC, and should not treat this change solely as a change in accounting standards, but rather as a structural change in the business model, which may affect several economic aspects.

Cova (2016) corroborates this prediction by highlighting that companies must establish action  plans  regarding  adjustments  to  key  performance  indicators,  as  well  as  assessing  the requirements  for  any  changes  to  internal  management  reports.  The  table  below  lists  these possible impacts that make up the above checklist. The idea is to verify if the companies object of study made this information widely available to users.

Thus, the items that guide the companies' level of compliance, which will be sought in their accounting information, are presented, leaving now the categorization and scoring criteria of  the  items  listed  above.  To  this  end,  this  classification  was  adapted  from  research  by Gonçalves (2011) and Oliveira et al. (2018) and is presented below.

Table 2 Adherence Level Classification Criteria

| Categories   | Classification Criteria                                                                                                                                                                         |   Score |

The proposed categorization finds argument in Bardin (1977), who emphasizes this as an efficient  way  of  organizing  elements  in  the  same  set,  according  to  their  similarities  and divergences. Malhotra et al. (2006) and Oliveira (2016) corroborate by mentioning that the elaboration  of  analytical  categories  for  the  classification  of  the  respective  elements  should follow clearly described rules, facilitating the grouping and content analysis.

The evaluated companies may reach the minimum of 8 (eight) points, for those that obtain all the 'restricted' results and the maximum of 32 points, for those that obtain 'broad' for all the evaluated items. The mentioned scores are obtained from the sum of scores of the 8 items highlighted.

From the companies' scores on this checklist, it is verified if the companies are adhering to CPC 47. From this, it will also be verified if the companies were already adequate or already drafting something about it before the norm became mandatory.

## 4 Data

This chapter includes a descriptive analysis of data regarding the level of adherence to CPC 47. The data that feeds the proposal of this work were obtained directly from the B3 website.  The  Financial  Statements  (Balance  Sheet  and  Income  Statement),  Management Reports and Notes available for the year 2018 (first three quarters) were analyzed.

The same documents were analyzed for 2017 (four quarters). According to Gonçalves (2011) and Oliveira (2016), it is common to analyze these documents in studies that seek to highlight  the  quality  of  information,  as  they  act  as  important  channels  of  communication between companies and the various stakeholders.

## 4.1 Descriptive Analysis of CPC Compliance Level 47 - Year 2018

The table below shows the score from the data collected for the five companies analyzed per quarter.

The analysis shows that the item 'Change in the availability of profits for distribution' was the only item that was not disclosed by any company. This information is significant to shareholders, as changes in the standard on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenues greatly affect the Income Statement, especially the amount of realized revenues, and the shareholders are dependent on the company's results for the consequent receipt of income. dividends.

It is noteworthy that the companies Telefonica Brazil and Telebras do not even mention CPC 47, something performed by the other companies. Operational actions to adapt to the new standard were taken by all companies, except for information concerning the first two quarters of Telebras. However, only Telefonica has disclosed such information widely. It is noteworthy that  the  mentioned  mention  of  this  company  is  for  compliance  with  IFRS  15,  but  that,  by harmonization, leads the same aspects raised for CPC 47.

With  the  exception  of  Telebras,  even  slightly  superficial  changes  in  performance indicators  were  evidenced,  especially  those  related  to  operating  performance  that  depend directly on the results for the year. Changes in compensation plans, which also depend on the company's results, were disclosed only by Algar Telecom in the first three quarters of 2018 and by Telebras in the third quarter. Aspects related to covenants were reported by all companies except Telebras in the first two quarters.

Despite the requirement, what can be seen from the table above is that there has not yet been a broad adherence to CPC 47 by the companies studied in the first three quarters of 2018, the year of the effective introduction of the standard in Brazilian publicly traded companies.

## 4.2 Descriptive Analysis of CPC Compliance Level 47 - Year 2017

As  an  additional  analysis,  we  sought  to  examine  the  financial  statements  and consolidated explanatory notes and the management reports, all quarterly, in the year 2017. Such  analyzes  are  underpinned  by  the  fact  that  the  standard  has  been  approved  by  the Accounting  Pronouncements  Committee  -  CPC  -  on  November  4,  2016  and  allowed  the retrospective  use  immediately  preceding  the  first  annual  period  as  a  way  to  aggregate comparative analyzes for previous periods, without obligation to do so. Table 5 shows the score from the data collected for the five companies analyzed by quarter.

In the first three quarters of 2017, Algar Telecom S / A, OI S/A and Telebras S / A did not disclose information about CPC 47, but in the last quarter, even without the obligation compliance with the new standard, have already sought to bring more information.

Of the three companies mentioned, we highlight the OI S / A that obtained the highest score in the 4th quarter of 2017, concerned with informing users about the adoption of CPC 47, operational  actions  to  adapt  to  the  requirements  of  the  standard,  the  possible  impacts  on indicators  and  other  important  metrics,  such  as  profit,  costs  and  revenue  segregation,  and mention review of controls and processes.

Telefonica Brazil and Tim Holdings S / A have been concerned since the beginning of 2017 in alerting users about the new CPC and its possible changes in the company's business, presenting the implementation and throughout the year, were improving and bringing more information about the process, being the two, in average score, the best ranked companies.

None of the company documents reviewed for 2017 found topics on the impact that the new CPC will have on the policy of profit availability and distribution, changes to targets or the timing of employee compliance, changes covenants, or tax policy.

Anyway, all aspects that were brought in the financial statements analyzed in 2017 are of a prospective nature, that is, none of them has worked with information disclosed in the new mandatory format. All make it clear that they are in the process of study and improvement. Therefore,  even  with  the  possible  gains  brought  by  voluntary  disclosure  (Dye,  2001; Verrecchia, 2001), companies did not choose to make such disclosure. As your own explanatory notes show, the costs of transitioning from the current standard to the new standard are high and more in line with what the 2014 KPMG Report says.

There is a tendency of increase in adherence to CPC 47 during 2017, and the annual information, which includes the information from the 4th quarter of the year, presents better disclosure, much because the information in this period has a broader scope. broad. Emphasis is given to the company Telefonica Brazil, which achieved 20 points out of 32 in the fourth quarter of 2017, reaching a adherence of 62.5% (20 ÷ 32). In addition, in relation to the others, this company also stood out regarding adherence to the first, second and fourth items of the checklist, which are mention of CPC 47, information on operational actions in order to adapt to the requirements of the standard, changes in indicators of performance and other key metrics and review of controls and processes.

The companies OI SA, Telebras and Algar Telecom did not even mention CPC 47 in the first three quarters of 2017. There was also no disclosure by any company regarding the last four items on the checklist, such as information on change in tax payment, availability of profits for distribution, compensation and bonus plan and potential compliance with loan covenants. In general, the table above showed that in 2017 there was no broad adherence to CPC 47 on a voluntary  basis,  even  with  the  possibility  of  gains  on  the  market  because  of  this,  by  the companies studied.

## 5 Conclusions

The objective of this study was to verify, within the telecommunications sector, whether Brazilian companies listed on B3 are broadly in line with CPC 47 - Customer Contract Revenue. Brazilian companies, in line with the convergence with international accounting standards, were required to issue their financial statements in accordance with this standard as of January 1, 2018,  and  retrospective  disclosure  is  accepted  for  periods  immediately  preceding  the  first annual period to that applies to the standard.

In  order  to  achieve  the  objective,  a  checklist  was  constructed  comprising  the  main requirements that companies should disclose, which corroborate their compliance with CPC 47. In each item, an adherence score of 1 to 4 was established, being 1 for companies that presented restricted information and 4 for companies that presented broad information. The data were collected  from  the  documentary  analysis  of  the  information  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  (Balance  Sheet  and  Income  Statement),  Explanatory  Notes  and  Management Reports of 2018 and 2017 of Algar Telecom S/A, OI S/A., Brazilian Telecommunications Telebras S/A, Telefonica Vivo Brazil S/A and Tim Holdings S/A.

In general, it was possible to verify that there was no broad adherence to CPC 47 by the companies studied. The results suggest a contrast with the statements of Cova (2016) and Silva (2018), which suggest that companies should broadly highlight the impact of the new standard on their  operations,  as  well  as  their  controls  and  results.  A  lower  level  of  compliance  with international  accounting  standards  demonstrates  reduced  reliability  and  comparability  of financial information and is not a reliable basis for efficient decision making and inferences for the future of various stakeholders.

Regarding  voluntary  disclosure,  there  was  no  interest  of  companies  in  disclosing information about revenues from contracts with customers before the period required by the standard. The omission of such information, as warned by Dye (2001), Verrecchia (2001) and Teixeira (2010), may not qualify the company as a differentiated investment opportunity, given that there are no greater informational subsidies than expected by the market.

In addition, aspects reported by Oliveira (2016), related to the increase of reputation and the improvement of the company's image, could serve as an incentive for disclosure more than the mandatory or before becoming mandatory. Therefore, it can be seen that the companies fit the line of Yamamoto and Salotti (2006), which probably verified preparation costs higher than the possible gains of additional disclosure.

A possible discussion for the results of this paper is whether, in fact, companies were prepared to adopt the new standard. The significant complexity in measurement and recognition and the high level of detail to the various elements of the contract, as evidenced by Souza and Souza (2015), may have been relevant for companies, due to lack of knowledge, not to adhere broadly  to  the  rules.  In  addition,  strong  complaints  from  Brazilian  companies,  especially regarding the high detail of information required by CPC 47 regarding disclosure, as shown by Tavares, Anjos and Paulo (2014), may have been fundamental to the low disclosure.

In this sense, the results brought by this work should be expanded to other companies, as one of the limitations of this study is precisely the research sample, which is intentional and non-random, so that the results obtained may not possibly be replicated to other companies not members of the selection. Therefore, for future research, it is suggested to broaden the scope of

the companies studied, addressing other sectors that could also be among the most impacted by the new standard, especially those poorly regulated, or even checking the companies of the new market, which As they are companies with a high level of corporate governance, they imply a high level of compliance with the mandatory disclosure standards.
