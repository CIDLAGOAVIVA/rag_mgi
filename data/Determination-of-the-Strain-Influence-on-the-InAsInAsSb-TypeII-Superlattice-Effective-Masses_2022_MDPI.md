Abstract: A 3 B 5 materials used for the superlattice (SL) fabrication have properties that enable the design of devices optimized for infrared (IR) detection. These devices are used in the military, industry, medicine and in other areas of science and technology. The paper presents the theoretical assessment and analysis of the InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x type-II superlattice (T2SL) (grown on GaSb buffer layer) strain impact on the bandgap energy and on the effective masses of electrons and holes at 150 K. The theoretical research was carried out with the use of the commercial program SimuApsys ( Crosslight ). The k p method was adopted in T2SL modeling. · Luttinger coefficients ( g 1 , g 2 and g 3 ) were assessed assuming the Kane coefficient F = 0. The bandgap energy of ternary materials (InAs Sb1 x -x ) was determined assuming that the bowing parameter ( b g) for the above-mentioned temperature is b g = 750 meV. The cutoff wavelength values were estimated based on the theoretically determined absorption coefficients (from approximation the quadratic absorption coefficient). The bandgap energy was calculated according to the following formula: E g = 1.24/ l cutoff . The theoretical simulations allowed us to conclude that the strain in T2SL causes the E g shift, which also has an impact on the effective masses m e and m h , playing an important role for the device's optical and electrical performance. The T2SLs-simulated results at 150 K are comparable to those measured experimentally.

## 1. Introduction

The InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x type-II superlattices (T2SLs) lattice matched to GaSb have recently been proposed as a HgCdTe alternative for medium to long infrared photodetectors [1-4] due to the stronger immunity to tunneling and reduced Auger generation. Lattice constants of the T2SL materials are around 6.1 Å [5], and hence can be grown on a GaSb substrate. The InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SLs are promising materials for infrared applications [6,7]. The T2SLs InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x bandgap energy mostly depends on the SL layers thickness and on the Sb molar composition. In addition, the T2SLs bandgap energy is closely related to the strain within structure. Effective masses of electrons and holes are important material parameters affecting most carrier transport properties. In the papers [8,9], the studies of electrons and holes effective masses were carried out for T2SL with the Sb molar composition x = 0.4 and x = 0.5 (for the LWIR range). The smaller hole and electron effective masses can lead to reduced scattering, what explains the high quantum efficiency that has been observed for InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL detectors [8,9]. The research on the InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SLs effective masses for the MWIR range is quite important, because detectors optimized for this cutoff wavelength are widely used in safety industry, medicine and for a wide range of applications in the fields of science and technology. In this paper, we present the results of simulations performed for InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SLs by the k p method [2,10]. We considered T2SLs grown on GaSb substrate and determined · the absorption edge and band structure at the temperature T = 150 K. We focus on the effective masses T2SL as a function of the molar composition and period thickness of the superlattice. We present our results in order to show the effect of the strain on the electron and heavy-hole effective masses in T2SL.

## 2. Materials and Methods

The T2SL made of InAs and InAs1 -x Sb x exhibits a strain. For their bandgap energy, they have applications found in medium-wave (MWIR) and long-wave (LWIR) IR detector capabilities (the bandgap energy that can vary from 3 µ m to 30 µ m by changing the thicknesses of the components and the Sb molar composition). The InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL consists of a large number of thin periodically stacked InAs and InAs1 -x Sb x layers. The k p · method was used in the theoretical modeling the T2SL. This method makes it possible to obtain the band structure of the superlattice as well as to estimate the absorption coefficient. The idea of method k p is to solve the Schrödinger equation [11,12]. · InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL was simulated by the commercial software SimuApsys ( Crosslight ). Figure 1 shows schematic energy band of the T2SL without considering the strain in InAs and InAs1 -x Sb . x The electrons in InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SLs are confined in InAs, while holes are confined in InAs1 -x Sb . The bandgap energy of T2SLs is defined as the energy gap between the x bottom of the lowest electron mini-band ( E c1 ) and the top of the highest hole mini-band ( E hh1 ) (see Figure 1).

The black line represents the InAs1 -xSb x and InAs conduction and valence bands, while blue and red line represents the electron and hole mini-bands (heavy-hh1 and light-lh1) in InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL. The blue and red dashed line represents the electron and hole density, respectively. Electrons for InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL are confined in InAs, while holes in InAs1 -x Sb . The band structure calculation is an important step of detector x modeling [13]. The T2SLs bandgap energy is defined as the energy between the bottom of the lowest electron mini-band and the top of the highest hole mini-band (see Figure 1).

First, an analysis of the absorption coefficient, a , versus cutoff wavelength was performed to evaluate the bandgap energy ( E g = 1.24/ l cutoff ). Figure 2 shows the example of theoretically calculated absorption coefficients for 150 K (Sb molar composition x = 0.38) for three wavevector range: k = 0.01 (2 π / ), a k = 0.06 (2 π / ) and a k = 0.6 (2 π / ). Figure 2 shows a that the higher absorption coefficient corresponds to higher wavevector, but the position of cutoff wavelength does not change. In the modeling, data from Table 1 were used. The overlap between the conduction band ( E c) of InAs and the valence band ( E v) of InAs1 -x Sb x in our simulations was accepted in the 90-140 meV range.

The bandgap energy was extracted from the quadratic absorption coefficient approximation [13]. The energy gap determined in this way is consistent with the value calculated

The T2SL bandgap energy decreases with an increase in the size of the SL period. The introduction of additional strain lowers the E g  value, and this decrease is greater with the increase in the Sb molar composition in the InAs1 xSb  layer. This is because the strain -x increases versus x . Figure 6 shows the dependence of the structure period with a Sb molar composition for a strain-balanced and strained structure, for T2SL 0.22 eV with a bandgap energy at T = 150 K corresponding to λ cutoff = 5.6 µm. For structures with higher strains, the same bandgap energy can be reached with a much smaller SL period. The T2SL bandgap energy decreases with an increase in the size of the SL period.

It  can be seen of Figure 7a,b that the electrons' and holes' effective masses for the balanced T2SL remain almost the same (blue curve) versus the Sb molar composition. For the  strained  T2SL  with  equal  layer  thicknesses  ( L InAs   = L InAsSb ),  the  electrons'  effective masses increase slightly, and those of the holes decrease strongly. Analyzing the effective masses  of  the  'inverted'  T2SL,  one  can  see  that  the  mass  of  electrons  increases  very strongly versus the Sb molar composition, while the mass of heavy holes remains almost the same (it slightly decreases). From these analyses, it can be concluded that a strainbalanced structure is more stable than strained one.  ons have comparable values in the The change in the SL period significantly affects the electrons' and holes' effective masses,  especially  in  the  hich may allow the comparison of the k z   direction.

The  strains The change in the SL period significantly affects the electrons' and holes' effective masses, especially in the k z direction. Figure 8 shows the electrons' (a) and holes' (b) effective masses for direction k z for the strain-balanced and strained SL with the Sb molar composition for the 0.22 eV SL bandgap energy. When the thickness of the L T2SL increases, the holes' effective masses decrease, while the electrons' masses increase. The strains increase the electrons' and holes' masses for InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL. For the balanced MWIR T2SLs InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x with the period L T2SL = 7 nm at T = 150 K, the calculated e 1 and hh1 effective masses in the k x, k y directions (parallel) and k z directions (perpendicular) of the Brillouin zone are: m e(x) = 0.019 m 0 , m e(z) = 0.587 m 0 , m hh(x) = 0.041 m 0 and m hh(z) = 5.677 m 0 . For example, in [9], the effective masses of the electrons have comparable values in the x directions and are on the level of 0.028 m 0 . Theoretical modelings by the authors [9] were conducted at the T = 100 K, which may allow the comparison of the order of magnitude and dynamics of change in electrons' and holes' effective masses.

how to choose the T2SL period and the Sb molar composition of the InAs1 -x Sb x to obtain devices for the MWIR range. The paper showed that the reduction in period T2SL and increase in InAs1 -x Sb x antimony molar composition allows us to reach the same absorption edge. For structures with a higher strain, the same bandgap energy can be obtained with a much smaller T2SL period. As the strain increases, the absorption coefficient increases, and the carrier effective masses grow. We showed that the SL period significantly affects the electrons' and holes' effective masses, especially in the k z direction. The InAs/InAs1 -x Sb x T2SL energy band structure was calculated and the results show a good agreement with the results in the literature.
