The chemical doping of molecular semiconductors is based on electron-transfer reactions between the semiconductor and dopant molecules; here, the redox potential of the dopant is key to control the Fermi level of the semiconductor 1,2 . The tunability and reproducibility of chemical doping are limited by the availability of dopant materials and the effects of impurities such as water. Here we focused on proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) reactions, which are widely used in biochemical processes 3,4 ; their redox potentials depend on an easily handled parameter, that is, proton activity. We immersed p-type organic semiconductor thin films in aqueous solutions with PCET-based redox pairs and hydrophobic molecular ions. Synergistic reactions of PCET and ion intercalation resulted in efficient chemical doping of crystalline organic semiconductor thin films under ambient conditions. In accordance with the Nernst equation, the Fermi levels of the semiconductors were controlled reproducibly with a high degree of precision-a thermal energy of about 25 millielectronvolts at room temperature and over a few hundred millielectronvolts around the band edge. A reference-electrode-free, resistive pH sensor based on this method is also proposed. A connection between semiconductor doping and proton activity, a widely used parameter in chemical and biochemical processes, may help create a platform for ambient semiconductor processes and biomolecular electronics.

Precise control of the Fermi level and carrier concentration through doping is essential for semiconductor devices. The Fermi energy must be tuned with a high degree of precision-a thermal energy of around 25 meV at room temperature and over a few hundred millielectronvolts around the band edge-to control the electronic properties of semiconductors. Impurity doping is used to introduce dopant atoms at parts-per-million-scale concentrations  to the semiconductor silicon. 5 Chemical doping by introducing dopant molecules has been used for organic semiconductors (OSCs) to fabricate advanced optoelectronic devices and materials in various structures through a solution process 6-8 . Chemical doping is based on redox reactions between semiconducting and dopant molecules 1,9 . Control of the doping level can be achieved by energy-level alignment and structural mixing between semiconducting and dopant molecules 10-12 . Tetracyanoquinodimethane derivatives, for example, show increasing dopant strength as the number of fluorine atoms in their molecular structures increases 13 . However, tuning the doping levels of OSCs precisely at the 25-meV scale by simply using various dopant molecules from a limited selection remains a challenging endeavour.

self-doping with covalently bound dopants 21 , Lewis acid and base reactions 22,23 , and activation processes with light, heat or catalysts 24-26 , have been combined with chemical doping to improve the stability of dopants and doped materials. However, the effects of the environment and water are generally expected to decrease the reproducibility of the Fermi level of OSCs obtained using redox-active dopants.

During the actual chemical doping process, the atmosphere and impurities, such as water, exert considerable effects on the resulting doping levels. For instance, water deactivates dopants through redox reactions 1,14 . Stable dopants for single or fractional-electron-transfer reactions 13 , including dimerized dopants 15-17 , have been developed using synthetic chemistry. Various phenomena, including ion exchange 18-20 ,

Molecular redox reactions that are precisely controlled under ambient conditions have been found in biochemical processes, where PCET reactions occur in addition to one-electron-transfer reactions. For instance, two-electron- and two-proton-transfer reactions are used to develop a difference in electrochemical potential of protons across a membrane for cellular energy production 3,4 . As a simple example of a reversible PCET reaction, benzoquinone (BQ) receives two electrons and two protons to transform into the neutral molecule hydroquinone (HQ) 27 . BQ and HQ do not react with water owing to their weakly oxidizing and reducing nature, which renders them stable redox agents in ambient conditions. In addition to this, the redox potential of the BQ/HQ PCET reaction is tuned by pH according to the Nernst equation (59 mV per pH unit). However, PCET reactions can not be used for efficient chemical doping because the redox agents transform into neutral molecules without supplying dopant ions. Dopant ions need to be supplied through redox reactions to compensate charge carriers in semiconductors.

In this study, we developed a chemical doping process that is controlled by an unconventional parameter, namely, proton activity, which

can be tuned easily by over ten orders of magnitude. When OSC thin films were immersed into aqueous solutions with BQ/HQ and hydrophobic molecular ions, p-type doping was confirmed through absorption and conductivity measurements. Although the PCET reactions do not produce ionic species that may serve as dopant ions, synergistic reactions of PCET and intercalation of hydrophobic ions were found to result in efficient chemical doping of OSCs (Fig. 1a). In accordance with the Nernst equation, the Fermi level of an OSC thin film was controlled by proton activity in our method. In situ monitoring of the Fermi level was also demonstrated by electrode potential measurements. Here, with a help of optimum dopant ions 18,19 and doping levels, coherent electronic systems with improved stability and desirable electronic properties can be achieved. Doping levels were defined reproducibly in pH-controlled aqueous solutions containing PCET-based redox agents and dopant ions under ambient conditions, which demonstrates unprecedented scalability, stability and tunability compared with conventional chemical doping methods that have been conducted in vacuum or organic solvents in inert atmospheres. Our method may also contribute to bioelectronic applications including reference-electrode-free, resistive pH sensors proposed in this study. The PCET-based route will connect semiconductor doping with any chemical or biochemical process that can alter proton activity and may serve as a platform for ambient semiconductor processing and biomolecular electronics.

## Chemical doping in aqueous solutions

In this study, we used the BQ/HQ redox pair, which exhibits a twoelectron, two-proton PCET reaction, to control p-type doping efficiency

in an aqueous solution. Conventional p-type dopants produce holes in OSCs via one- or fractional-electron-transfer reactions 13 . Such dopants are deactivated when an electron-transfer reaction occurs with water in the environment 1,14 . The stability of dopants is particularly problematic when the electron affinity of a dopant is comparable to or larger than the redox potential for the oxidation of water. BQ shows only a small electron affinity for a one-electron-transfer reaction 28 , which is not sufficiently large to effectively oxidize neutral water. In addition to the one-electron-transfer reaction, BQ/HQ exhibits a two-electron, two-proton PCET reaction in aqueous solution.

The redox potential of BQ/HQ in an aqueous solution is described by the Nernst equation as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where E 0 is the standard electrode potential of BQ/HQ and [BQ] and [HQ] are the activities of BQ and HQ, respectively. The BQ/HQ redox potential is smaller than the redox potential for the oxidation of water and larger than the redox potential for the reduction of water 29 ; these potentials show the same pH dependence (Fig. 1b). Thus, redox reactions with water would not affect the BQ/HQ redox system, even under ambient and aqueous conditions, in contrast to conventional dopants. On the basis of equation (2) and the potential difference between the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and a vacuum 30 , the BQ/HQ redox potentials are -5.14 eV (versus vacuum) at pH 0 and -4.73 eV (versus vacuum) at pH 7 when [BQ] equals [HQ], because E 0 is 0.6995 V versus SHE at 25 °C (ref. 31). The highest occupied molecular orbital band edge of spin-coated poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2b ] thiophene) 32 (PBTTT; Fig. 1c), which is a well studied p-type OSC 11,19,20,33,34 , is -4.8 eV (ref. 18), which suggests energetically favourable PCET between PBTTT and BQ in a low-pH aqueous solution.

Our doping method involves the two-electron, two-proton PCET reaction of BQ/HQ and anion intercalation, the mechanism of which is assumed to be as follows (Fig. 1a). The PCET reaction proceeds when the pH-dependent E BQ/HQ matches or exceeds the Fermi level of PBTTT (pH-dependent redox reaction process). Dopant anions are intercalated into the OSC thin film to compensate for the injected holes (anion intercalation process). These processes occur in series or simultaneously to dope a PBTTT thin film with the anion species Y  without disturbing -the crystallinity of the film (Fig. 1d). In this study, the above model was verified by the experimental results.

We evaluated the doping efficiency of our method by conducting ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-vis-NIR) and conductivity measurements on the doped PBTTT thin films (Fig. 1e,f). The spin-coated PBTTT thin films were immersed in aqueous solutions of BQ and/or various salts at pH 2 for 20 min. The measurements were performed in air. The pristine film showed neutral absorption at approximately 554 nm (refs. 10,35). When the PBTTT film was immersed in an aqueous solution with only BQ, changes in absorption were not observed. Immersion in aqueous solutions with only bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (TFSI) or bis(nonafluorobutanesulfonyl) imide (NFSI) anions did not result in efficient doping. In this case, a slight increase in the doping level was observed owing to oxidation by dissolved oxygen in the aqueous solution (Extended Data Fig. 1). By contrast, immersion in aqueous solutions containing both BQ and dopant salts decreased the neutral absorption of the films, which shows that the efficient doping of PBTTT proceeds through a pH-dependent redox reaction and anion intercalation. Conductivity measurements also showed that p-type doping proceeds efficiently in the presence of both BQ and dopant salts. The conductivity of the PBTTT thin film reached a high value of about 180 S cm -1 , particularly when LiNFSI was combined with BQ.

The use of large, non-nucleophilic anions for p-doping results in high tolerance to ambient air 36 . The results thus show that NFSI  and TFSI --are suitable dopant candidates, as demonstrated experimentally 33,37 .

The higher doping level achieved with NFSI  compared with that -achieved with TFSI  suggests that the Gibbs free energy gain in the -intercalation process affects the driving force of the doping reaction, similar to the case in organic solvents 18 and electrochemical doping in aqueous solutions 38,39 . These findings support the hypothesis that redox reactions by BQ and the intercalation of anions occur in our doping method.

## pH dependence of doping levels

We experimentally confirmed whether E BQ/HQ and the doping level of PBTTT depend on the solution pH following equation (2). The concentrations of BQ and HQ were fixed at 10 mM, while that of the dopant anion TFSI  was fixed at 100 mM in the following experiments (Figs. 2-4; -detailed conditions are listed in Supplementary Table 2). Compared with the amount of monomer units in a PBTTT thin film, approximately 5 nmol, that is estimated based on the reported crystalline structure 40 and volume of the thin film, those of BQ and HQ exceeded 1,000 equivalents. To confirm the dependence of the doping level on the pH of the doping solution, we initially assessed the changes in the absorption and conductivity of the PBTTT thin films. The extent of bleaching in the neutral peak (554 nm) in Fig. 2a shows that the doping level of PBTTT increases with decreasing pH. Conductivity measurements of the doped thin films reveal strong pH dependence, with higher conductivity obtained at lower pH (Fig. 2b). In particular, the conductivity of PBTTT immersed in an aqueous solution at pH 1 was about 23-times higher than that at pH 2. The increase in doping level at lower pH indicates that the two-electron, two-proton PCET of BQ/HQ is responsible for the doping reaction in our method.

The electrode potential of PBTTT during the doping process was measured with respect to a reference electrode to quantitatively assess the pH dependence of the doping strength (see Extended Data Fig. 2a for the measurement set-up). Here the measurement determined the Fermi level of the PBTTT thin film, which depends on the doping level, versus a silver (Ag)/silver chloride (AgCl) reference electrode. Figure 2c shows that the electrode potential of the film varied with a slope of -0.059 V as a function of pH, which agrees with the Nernst equation. The intercept of the fitting line at pH 0 was 0.50 V (versus Ag/AgCl), which agrees with the reported redox potential of BQ/HQ 31 . These results confirm that the two-electron, two-proton transfer reaction of BQ/HQ occurs in our doping method, which could precisely tune the Fermi level of PBTTT thin films with a thermal energy of 25 meV at room temperature by shifting the pH-dependent BQ/HQ redox potential.

We assessed the structural changes in the PBTTT thin films following doping using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 2d-f). As shown in Fig. 1d, the spin-coated PBTTT forms a semicrystalline lamellar structure, which shows an edge-on orientation with aromatic rings almost perpendicular to the substrate 40 . Out-of-plane XRD measurements revealed that the distance between planes ( d ) for the lamellar stacking increases with decreasing pH, which corresponds to an increase in the doping level (Fig. 2d). The increase in d -spacing implies that dopant anions are intercalated between the layers of the lamellar structures 11,38,41 . For the in-plane direction, the d -spacing of (010) originating from π -stacking decreased with the decrease in pH of the doping solution (Fig. 2e). These results suggest that structural changes following doping by our method are consistent with previous studies, where anions are intercalated into the lamellar structures of polymers without disturbing their crystallinity. In addition, the extent of anion intercalation was precisely controlled by changing the pH of the solution (Fig. 2f).

The anion species in the doped PBTTT thin films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 3).

The PBTTT thin films were immersed in aqueous solutions with BQ/ HQ and LiTFSI at various pH values. The data obtained from a pH 1 doping solution are shown here as a representative example (Fig. 3a). In addition to the carbon (C) and sulfur (S) atoms of PBTTT, nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) atoms were present in the thin film, which originate from the intercalated TFSI . We also confirmed an -additional S 2 p peak derived from the sulfone of the TFSI , especially -in the pH 1 sample (Supplementary Information). We used the F 1  and s C 1  peaks (Fig. 3b,c), which showed high intensities, to estimate the s amount of intercalated TFSI  based on the atomic ratio of F to C (ref. 33). -The plotted ratio of F to C in Fig. 3d suggests that the doping amount of TFSI  increases as the pH of the doping solution decreases. These -measurements indicate that TFSI  is intercalated into the PBTTT thin -films through our doping method, which is triggered by the PCET reaction of BQ/HQ. The above experimental results confirm that PCET and anion intercalation occur in the aqueous solution during doping via our method, as described in Fig. 1a.

Given the results of our UV-vis-NIR, conductivity, electrode potential, XRD and XPS measurements, we conclude that our doping method follows the model shown in Fig. 1a, where the doping level of PBTTT depends on the pH of the doping solution. For a detailed discussion on the equilibration of the potential 42,43 and doping levels, see Supplementary Section 1.7. Electrode potential measurement realized the in situ monitoring of the Fermi level of OSCs (see Extended Data Fig. 2 for the related schematics). The doping level can be tuned simply by controlling the pH of the doping solutions. In general, ionic concentrations, especially the proton concentration (pH), can easily be controlled by 15 orders of magnitude, which means our method uses a highly controllable source of electromotive force according to the Nernst equation. The ability of our simple and scalable method to achieve the precise and wide-range control of doping levels under ambient conditions is suitable for manufacturing OSC-based devices with large areas. It is noted that when a low-pH environment is problematic for the employed materials, other parameters such as species and concentrations of redox agents and salts can be optimized to achieve efficient doping in an aqueous solution at a moderate pH.

## Repeatable control of Fermi level

Both oxidizing and reducing agents have key roles in the precise control of the Fermi level. As indicated by the Nernst equation (2), the redox potential depends on the molecular ratio of the oxidizing (BQ) and

reducing (HQ) agents. In addition, when the OSC thin film is oxidized to a larger degree than the target doping level, for example, through a redox reaction with oxygen, the OSC thin film must be reduced to control the p-type doping level with high precision. In our doping method, the oxidation and reduction reactions of BQ and HQ with the OSCs achieved equilibrium, which will be clarified below. Figure 4a shows the variations in the resistance of a PBTTT thin film that was alternately immersed in aqueous doping solutions of BQ/HQ and LiTFSI at pH 2 and pH 4. The resistance of the PBTTT thin film decreased after immersion in the pH 2 doping solution and then increased after immersion in the pH 4 doping solution. When the sample was immersed in the pH 2 solution, the doping level of the PBTTT thin film increased through the PCET reaction with the oxidizing agent BQ. When the sample was immersed in the pH 4 solution, the doping level decreased through PCET with the reducing agent HQ. The crystallinity of the thin film was maintained throughout these processes (Extended Data Fig. 3). These results indicate that the oxidation and reduction reactions of the PBTTT thin film occur in our doping solution owing to the presence of both BQ and HQ (Fig. 4b). Thus, the equilibrium of these redox reactions can realize the precise control of the doping levels of OSCs in our method even when redox-active impurities, including oxygen, exist in the reaction environment 37 . One advantage of using a PCET-based redox pair is that both oxidants and reductants are stable, closed-shell compounds. When a conventional electron-transfer-based dopant is used, either the oxidant or reductant is a radical species, which may lead to stability problems of the dopant in the process environment.

The use of both oxidizing and reducing agents suggests possibilities for the development of OSCs. The successful reduction of the OSC thin film suggests the possibility of using PCET-based redox pairs for reducing OSCs (n-type doping). Moreover, the inherent (observed) repeatability of the doping method could lead to the development of novel sensors, such as resistive pH sensors, as demonstrated by the large change (×10 ) in the resistance of the film immersed in doping 2 solutions of pH 2 and pH 4. While the above results for PBTTT thin films show excellent pH sensitivity, especially below pH 4, the response of the system to pH values of approximately 7 can be improved by optimizing the parameters in our system. To accomplish an effective doping reaction in the neutral-pH region, where BQ shows relatively low oxidation ability, we prepared an OSC with a relatively small ionization potential and the bulky dopant anion NFSI . These optimization steps led to -observable pH-dependent resistance changes in the OSC thin films over the pH range of 1-7 (Extended Data Fig. 4). These findings present possibilities for OSCs in the field of bioelectronics.

## High doping levels through PCET

Finally, we demonstrate that our chemical doping method achieves significantly high doping levels in aqueous solutions. The Gibbs free energy gain in the redox reaction or anion intercalation processes can be controlled to increase the doping level of the PBTTT film. The doping solution pH, standard electrode potential and concentration (activity) of redox agents are key parameters for increasing the oxidizing strength of the doping solution. Many other quinone derivatives can be used instead of BQ. In this experiment, we used 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4benzoquinone (DDQ; Fig. 5a) as a stronger oxidant compared with BQ. The chemical structure and concentration of anion are key parameters for controlling the anion intercalation process in a given semiconductor film 18 , as indicated by the difference in doping levels between the cases with TFSI  and NFSI  (Fig. 1e,f). Absorption and conductivity measure---ments (Fig. 5b,c) show a clear difference in doping level based on the choice of quinone species and dopant salts. We estimated the ionization potential values of the doped PBTTT thin films from the threshold in photoelectron yield spectroscopy measurements by plotting the photoelectron yield as a function of the incident photon energy (Fig. 5d).

The estimated ionization potential was equal to the work function of heavily doped PBTTT thin films and showed the strength of doping 33 . When the oxidant was changed from BQ to DDQ, the ionization potential value increased by about 0.22 eV, which is comparable to the difference in their standard electrode potentials 27 . Changing the anion from TFSI  to NFSI  produced a similar effect on the ionization --potential value, thereby demonstrating that the choice of anion is as important as the choice of the redox agent. When a PBTTT thin film was immersed in an aqueous solution of DDQ and LiNFSI at pH 2, the ionization potential value reached 5.54 eV. This value exceeds the redox potential of the H O/O  couple at pH 7 (-5.25 eV versus vacuum), which 2 2 is considered the limit under ambient conditions 14 . In this experiment, when an aqueous solution of pH 2 was used, the redox potential of H O/ 2 O2 was -5.55 eV versus vacuum, which allows for strong chemical doping beyond the conventional limit under ambient conditions. The doping levels of PBTTT thin films were also quantitatively estimated from XPS measurements based on the composition ratios of F and C atoms. The F/C ratios for combinations of DDQ-NFSI and DDQ-TFSI were 0.299 and 0.104, which are equivalent to 0.83 and 0.76 holes per monomer unit based on the atomic composition of the employed materials, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5).

## Conclusions

In this study, we developed a two-electron, two-proton PCET-based chemical doping method for molecular semiconductors in aqueous solution under ambient conditions. Unlike conventional chemical doping methods, reactions with water and oxygen did not affect the resulting doping level in our method with BQ/HQ. In accordance with the Nernst equation, the redox potential of the redox pair and Fermi

level of the OSCs were precisely and reproducibly tuned by the pH of the doping solution; here, the actual Fermi level can be monitored in situ through electrode potential measurements. Synergistic reactions of PCET and dopant ion intercalation enable one to choose proper dopant ions to improve doping efficiency, stability and electronic properties of crystalline, doped OSCs.

## Article

## Methods

## Chemical doping

The PBTTT thin films were fabricated on standard EAGLE XG glass substrates for UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and XRD analysis and on chromium/gold-patterned or -covered EAGLE XG glass substrates for conductivity, potential, XPS and photoelectron yield spectroscopy measurements. The thin films were deposited via spin coating from an o -dichlorobenzene solution at a spinning speed of 2,000 rpm for 1 min. The resulting films were annealed in a vacuum oven at 180 °C for 1 h and then slowly cooled to room temperature.

The PBTTT films were washed with deionized water and then doped by simply immersing them in aqueous dopant solutions at room temperature. The doping solutions were prepared by dissolving BQ and HQ in a pH-controlled aqueous solution. After immersion, the films were removed from the solution and the residual solvent was blown away by a nitrogen flow. Details of the film preparation and doping procedures are presented in Supplementary Information.

## XRD analysis

XRD data were acquired using a RIGAKU SmartLab with a MicroMax007HF  X-ray  generator  using  Cu Kα  radiation  (wavelength λ = 0.15418 nm). For the out-of-plane direction, the θ - 2 θ method was used, where 2 θ is the diffraction angle. For the in-plane direction, data were acquired by converting two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray scattering images that are shown in Supplementary Information.

## XPS analysis

XPS was used to evaluate the atomic composition of the doped PBTTT films and estimate their doping level. XPS was performed using a KRATOS ULTRA 2 instrument with monochromatic Al Kα X-rays. We focused on the C 1  and F 1  spectra of PBTTT thin films doped with s s TFSI to determine the ratio of F to C atoms.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Effects of dissolved oxygen on the p-type doping of PBTTT thin films.a , Conductivities of PBTTT thin films immersed in aqueous solutions with LiTFSI at pH 1-4. Solution pH was adjusted by H SO  and KOH. 2 4 The error bars indicate uncertainties in the conductivity mainly stemming from uncertainties in the thickness of the PBTTT thin films and represent 1 s.d. among four individual samples. The markers indicate average values. b , UV-vis-NIR spectra of PBTTT thin films immersed in aqueous solutions with LiTFSI at pH 1. The red and blue lines refer to samples immersed without and with Ar bubbling, respectively. The plots suggest that dissolved oxygen promotes p-type doping at lower pH by the uncontrolled way in contrast to BQ/HQ.
