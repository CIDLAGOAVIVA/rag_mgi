## ABSTRACT

This  paper  highlights  the  perspectives  of  defence  workers  regarding  a  Just Transition  of  their  industry,  one  of  the  most  environmentally  harmful  sectors in  terms  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  pollution  and  use  of  nonrenewable resources. It is based on (i) interviews with defence sector workers in the United States and the United Kingdom (n58); and (ii) focus groups with key representatives of national and international labour unions, defence companies and relevant NGOs (n18). Some of these defence workers and their trade union representatives envisioned a transformational path towards sustainability, including converting the defence sector to more socially useful production. Drawing on Gramsci, we define these as 'counter-hegemonic views', since they challenge the hegemonic 'growth coalition' and 'treadmill of destruction' paradigms.  Such  views  support  and  echo  more  radical  interpretations  of  Just Transition, emphasising the necessity of a structural transformation of society to achieve a fair and effective transition to sustainability.

## Introduction

The defence sector is responsible for exceptionally high levels of GHGs, pollution and use of non-renewable resources (Bigger and Neimark 2017, Crawford 2019, Belcher et al .  2020, Parkinson 2020a). Analysis indicates that the world's militaries combined, and the industries that provide their equipment, contribute 6% to global GHG emissions (SGR 2021a, 2021b). Moreover, as Parkinson (2020a, p. 17) highlights, . . . the military is a unique sector, in that the use of its products,

i.e. weapons, often leads to considerable further GHG emissions, including fires from burning buildings, fuel depots and vegetation, healthcare for civilian and military survivors, and post-conflict reconstruction. Hence, the defence sector needs to be part of the accelerated action to achieve a liveable future that scientists are  calling  for  (IPCC  2022)  and  the  social  dialogue  needed  to  achieve  a  Just Transition.

The 'Just Transition' (JT) concept focuses on the equity issues that could arise  from  the  transition  to  sustainability.  Typologies  of  JT  have  located different models on a spectrum according to the type of transition envisioned and the actions that need to be undertaken, ranging from a 'worker-focused' /'managerial'  approach  at  one  end  to  a  'structural'/'transformative'  endeavour at the other (Morena et al . 2020, Just Transition Research Collaborative 2018, Kalt 2021, Krawchenko and Gordon 2021). The structural interpretation tends to be the broadest, considering JT as a means to improve the lives of  workers  and  their  communities,  as  well  as  to  address  the  problems  of society  as  a  whole,  advocating  for  system  transformation.  In  this  latter interpretation, equity, justice and inclusion at local, national and global levels are  seen  to  be  vital  elements  of  JT.  This  would  include  the  procedural, distributional, recognition, restorative and substantive aspects of these concepts (see, for example, Bell 2014, 2020, Abram et al . 2022).

The way that JT is interpreted has important implications for campaigns and policy responses and, therefore, it remains a highly contested term, often disputed in social struggles (see, for example, Kalt 2021). It might be assumed that workers would only be interested in the question of maintaining jobs in the  transition  to  sustainability  and  less  in  the  wider  implications  of  their work. This article argues that this may not be the case and that some workers subscribe to a more transformational vision of JT and, indeed, consider it necessary for an effective societal transition to sustainability.

The paper draws on Gramsci's (1971) insights into how transformative change can be achieved. Noting that rule occurs, not just by coercion but also through consent; he argued that this consent is  supported  by 'hegemony', generally understood to be a form of power that presents the interests of the globally powerful as universal interests, thereby gaining the support of other classes.  Here,  we  are  using  the  term  'hegemony'  to  refer  to  the  societally dominant discourse and practice on how to transition to sustainability, i.e. through technical changes that enable business-as-usual, without addressing the drivers of unsustainability, including perpetual economic growth and the profit  imperative.  A  narrower  conception  of  JT  does  not  fundamentally challenge  economic  and  political  power,  whereas  a  more  transformative vision  of  JT  could  be  considered  'counter-hegemonic'  to  this  dominant perspective.

Gramsci argued that hegemony is made stable by a 'historic bloc' made up of  alliances  across  social  groups  and  class  interests.  In  order  to  challenge

aspects of the dominant capitalist system and thereby the interests of economic  elites,  a  'counter-hegemonic  bloc'  must  be  formed  which  includes subaltern agents as well as intellectuals  and social leaders  (Gramsci 1971). A counter-hegemonic bloc for challenging the dominant societal approach to addressing unsustainability could be formed around a transformative interpretation of JT as an 'ideological element around which a coalition of change agents  coalesces'  (Winkler  2020,  p.  10).  Alongside  workers,  as  subaltern actors, other change agents that could join this historic bloc for transformation  might  include  ENGOs  (environmental  non-governmental  organisations); and social justice organisations.

In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  defence  workers'  counter-hegemonic  views about how to achieve sustainability and their alignment with a more transformative  vision  of  JT.  This  focus  is  taken  because  (1)  these  views  are relatively  unexplored  in  the  literature  on  defence  and  sustainability;  (2) they  are  counter  intuitive  for  defence  sector  workers  and,  as  such,  have interesting implications; and (3) they relate to Gramsci's theory of counterhegemonic alliance and, as such, indicate the potential for a transformational Just Transition. The views that were more consistent with a narrower conception of JT and the full range of views can be found in the project reports and the original datasets (see www.decarbonising-defence.co.uk and the UK Data Archive Data Catalogue, under 'Data Collection #855918').

## Background

The UK government is now committed to a legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target of 78% by 2035 (Gov.UK 2021) and the US government is currently considering the 'CLEAN Future Act' bill (CFA 2021) with a  national  goal  to  achieve  net  zero  GHG  emissions  by  2050.  Yet,  it  is estimated that the MoD accounts for 50% of UK Government GHG emissions and the US DoD consumes 80% of US Government energy (Crawford 2019, Barry 2021). Within this context, reduction of defence GHG emissions has become a government priority for both countries. Government defence departments  have  also  highlighted  the  security  aspects  of  climate  change resulting from extreme weather events, sea level rise and desertification, all of which have the potential to increase conflict (e.g. MoD 2021, NATO 2021). Defence sector companies have also been setting sustainability targets, claiming greatly diminished GHG emissions as a result of their net zero activities and issuing plans regarding how they will continue to meet these targets (e.g. Honeywell 2021). BAE Systems have committed to achieving net zero GHGs across their operations by 2030 (Sutcliffe 2021) as have Rolls Royce (Rolls Royce 2021) and GKN Aerospace has a target to achieve net zero GHGs by 2050 (GKN 2021).

However, while governments, defence companies and military organisations are now, to some extent, acknowledging the environmental impacts of their  operations,  their  solutions  are  primarily  technical,  focussed  almost entirely  on  decarbonisation  rather  than  wider  sustainability  issues,  and with no intention to scale back operations. Indeed, the UK government has recently  announced  its  intention  to  double  military  spending  and  to  lift defence  spending  overall  from  2.1%  of  GDP  to  3%  by  2030  (Sabbagh 2022). Furthermore, the NATO national spending target of 2% of GDP on militaries is considered likely to increase military-related GHGs (Lunn and Williams 2017). The technical approach avoids consideration of the fundamental political and economic systems of militarism and capitalism that are driving  unsustainability.  Overall  plans  and  actions  have  included:  Using more  of  the  defence  estate  to  generate  renewable  energy  or  for  capture carbon;  increasing  use  of  biofuels  for  powering  ships  and  aircraft  (see Bowcott et al .  2021); increasing energy efficiency; electrifying vehicle fleets (e.g. US Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, in Vergun 2021); developing more efficient  engines  and  materials  (IATA  2019);  increasing  the  use  of  carbon offsets (Bowcott et al . 2021); and reducing the use of manned vehicles (Nugee in Owen-Burge 2021: np.). For example, the MoD's (2021) 'Climate Change and Sustainability  Strategic  Approach'  document  states  that  there  is  to  be increased use of robotic and autonomous systems, biofuels, nuclear power, solar  panels,  tree  planting  and  carbon  offsetting.  Similar  activities  were proposed  in  the  2020  'Sustainability  Report  and  Implementation  Plan'  of the  US  Department of Defense (DoD) (Bowcott et  al .  2021)  and  the  2022 'Climate Strategy' of the US Army (2022).

However,  the  technologies  suggested  may  be  inadequate  for  achieving sustainability  and  some  may  exacerbate  environmental  and  social  harm. There have been particular criticisms of the proposed fossil fuel replacements (e.g. Bigger  and  Neimark  2017,  Gardner  2017,  Parkinson  2021).  As Parkinson (2020a, 2020b, 2021) points out, biofuel and nuclear, while low in  carbon  emissions,  are  still  detrimental  to  the  environment  in  terms  of biodiversity and toxicity. The plans and statements of the governments and defence companies do not take into account the full range of environmental crises  (Steffen et  al .  2015).  Technical  fixes  that  apply  to  just  one  of  these emergencies may create problems elsewhere. Even the use of the 'net zero' language is, itself, problematic in that this policy goal includes the use of risky and  ineffective  carbon  capture  technologies  to  attempt  to  remove  excess emissions from the atmosphere, thereby reducing the incentive to emit less (Dyke et al . 2021).

Furthermore,  the  strategies  overlook  the  environmental  impacts  of engaging  in  war  and  reconstructing  after,  such  as  the  destruction  of ecological habitats and replacing buildings and infrastructure (Darbyshire  and  Weir  2021).  Moreover,  the  defence  industry and

<!-- image -->

government  plans  lack  consideration  of  how  to  avoid  war,  for  example, through  diplomacy,  arms  control  and  disarmament  treaties.  State  subsidies  for  defence  are  high  in  the  main  weapons  producing  countries (CAAT  2014)  and,  with  a  range  of  ecological  emergencies  to  address, these  subsidies  might  be  better  used  for  mitigation  and  adaptation  of these  crises,  as  in  a  green  'peace  dividend'.  There  are  also  many  social causes that would benefit from such subsidies, such as providing adequate sanitation  systems  for  the  Global  South,  so  the  opportunity  cost  of military  spending  is  an  important  issue.  As  the  IPCC  (2022,  p.  84) recently  stated,  '  . . .  moderate  reductions  in  military  spending  (which may  involve  conflict  resolution  and  cross-country  agreements  on  arms limitations)  could  free  up  considerable  resources  for  the  SDG  agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and in the form of ODA'.

The technical approach to transitioning the defence sector fits with the eco-modernist  hegemony  of  the  Global  North,  based  on  maintaining a  Western  lifestyle  and  dominance,  and  achieving  'green  growth'  (Velicu and Barca 2020). Economic growth is pursued as the supposed solution to all social  ills  and  now  environmental  ills  can  also  be  solved  through  'green growth' (e.g. Labour 'green growth' strategy, 2022). The historic bloc supporting the growth hegemony has been described as the 'growth coalition' which  includes  the  state,  corporations,  and  workers  (Schnaiberg  1980, p. 205).

Growth  is  among  a  number  of  Dominant  Hegemonic  Environmental Discourses  (DHEDS)  that  Bell  (2014,  p.  9)  refers  to  as  'the  taken-forgranted beliefs about reality that define what is regarded as natural, normal, right and good, in addition to what is considered to be bad, other, undesirable  and  wrong'.  Bell  argues  that  these  encourage  reductionist,  high-tech, growth-orientated solutions. The defence sector fits easily into this framing as  it  has  long  been  associated  with  jobs,  growth  and,  ironically,  'peace'. Drawing on Schnaiberg's (1980)  'treadmill  of  production'  where  nature  is increasingly appropriated for power and wealth, the defence sector has been termed the 'treadmill of destruction' (Hooks and Smith 2005) to signify the growth dynamics of militaries and militarism.

In contrast to the dominant discourse, from within and beyond academia others have argued that a more fundamental political and economic change is  required  to  achieve  sustainability  (e.g.  Kovel,  2002;  Magdoff  and  Foster 2011,  Parr  2012,  Klein  2014,  Bell  2015,  2020).  These  analysts  argue  that, within the capitalist political economy, production is driven so that companies  can  profit,  rather  than  to  meet  social  needs  and  avert  environmental harm.  Within  capitalist  economies,  companies  have  to  make  short-term decisions based on enabling their business to survive, even if these decisions harm  society  and  the  environment.  At  the  same  time,  wealth  becomes concentrated,  allowing  the  large  companies  to  subvert  local,  national  and

international environmental democracy. For example, they are able to fund anti-environmental movements and electoral candidates and form powerful lobbies to shape government policies (see, for example, Faber 2008, Magdoff and  Foster  2011).  Their  power  was  apparent  at  the  recent  Glasgow  COP, where  fossil  fuel  representatives  outnumbered  any  national  delegations (Global Witness 2021).

Those who are critical of the growth hegemony suggest that we need to consider  the  type  and  quantity  of  production  necessary  for  human  and planetary wellbeing. 'Green growth' is considered unviable since decoupling environmental  growth  from  material  footprint  has  had  limited  success  to date, even under very optimistic conditions (Hickel and Kallis 2020, Vadén et  al .  2020,  Hickel  2021b).  Therefore,  a  case  is  made  for  reducing  overall production and consumption and focussing on producing solely that which has genuine social value (e.g. Hickel 2021a). From this perspective, with their limited focus, the government and defence company plans are inadequate for changing the trajectory of environmental harm.

## Just transition framing

The  workforce,  in  particular,  play  an  essential  role  in  the  treadmill  of production  and  the  treadmill  of  destruction,  as  actors  in  production,  as agents  of  the  growth  coalition  and  proponents  of  DHEDs.  Their  shortterm  material  survival  is  caught  up  with  the  aims  of  the  treadmill  and, hence,  this  has  tended  to  be  the  main  focus  of  labour  unions  to  date. Similarly,  defence  sector  workers  have  historically  often  come  to  see  their interests  intertwined  with  the  industry.  Brenes  (2014,  p.  4),  for  example, argued that defence workers, though not a homogenous political bloc (even at the height of the Cold War) 'became wedded to the national security state, regardless of where they fell on the political spectrum'. The maintenance of the  growth  collation  and  treadmill  of  destruction  for  defence  workers  is echoed in narrow conceptions of JT so that production is maintained with minimal disruption.

Ciplet and Harrison (2020) emphasize that JT processes are marked by contradictions,  tensions  and  trade-offs.  Hence,  while  governments  and defence industry companies do not appear to be explicitly discussing JT in relation to this sector at all (Bell et  al .  2022),  defence unions appear to be divided over interpretations of JT. For example, a recent European Union report covering the defence sector has discussed JT in relation to potential job  losses  resulting  from  regional  integration  without  any  reference  to ecological  issues  (e.g.  Shulze-Marmeling et  al .  2022).  In  the  UK,  major unions  such  as  Unite  and  PCS  have  backed  the  idea  of  diver  sification/ conversion of the defence sector (e.g. Unite 2016) while the GMB has been opposed (Bell et al .  2022). In the US, the main unions have not supported

<!-- image -->

conversion at the national level,  though  local  branches  have  ( ibid .).  These tensions were illustrated in the UK when the Trade Union Congress recently voted  by  a  very  narrow  majority  to  support  increased  arms  spending  a  change  in  policy  from  their  former  commitment  to  arms  diversification (Hudson 2022). During the debate, the difference in JT visions were highlighted  by  a  speaker  from  the  National  Education  Union  who  argued, 'Yesterday we passed a motion on a Just Transition. This is what we should fight for, that is a solution to these high-skilled jobs in Barrow and Derby and elsewhere, not investment in pointless, unproductive, murderous weapons' (in  Chacko  2022  np).  It  should  also  be  noted  that  (a)  the  motion  was a  composite,  mixed  with  a  general  argument  for  government  support  for UK manufacturing and (b) it was a card vote so most of the voters had not heard the debate in the room (TUC 2022). A more transformative approach was apparent in a recent conference organised by the European Trade Union Institute  entitled  'A  Just  Transition  Beyond  Growth?  (December  2022), where it was suggested that unnecessary production, including arms, should be 'scaled down' (Hickel 2022).

As  key  players,  workers  have  the  potential  to  overturn  the  'treadmill' (Schnaiberg 1980, Obach 2004, Kalt 2021) and the potential to form part of a counter-hegemonic alliance against weapons production on the grounds of its  social  and  environmental  harms.  Drawing  on  Gramsci,  Ciplet's  (2022) theory of transformative JT suggests that transformational policies are likely to  be  implemented  when  a  diverse  coalition  of  counter-hegemonic  forces, embedded in impacted communities, effectively mobilizes. Also, from a neoGramscian perspective, Winkler (2020) asserts the need to establish a new cultural hegemony to achieve JT. The interviews with the defence workers for this study indicate that, even if currently a minority view, there are already seeds of this new counter-hegemonic force.

## Method

The project was constructed as a form of 'workers' enquiry', a method that encourages workers to articulate their reflections on the productive process (Brown and Quan-Haase 2012). It has been used to gather data for research and  practice  when  shifts  in  production  are  taking  place  or  where  such changes could be on the horizon (Woodcock 2021). While it seeks to understand the world from the workers' point of view, the process can vary from using  traditional  empirical  methods  to  co-research  alongside  workers  as a  process  of  workplace  organisation  (Wright  2018).  In  this  enquiry,  we adopted  the  empirical  approach,  interviewing  past  and  present  defence sector workers (aged 18+) about defence decarbonising and wider sustainability policy and plans. Research ethics approval was given in November  2021  by  the  University  of  the  West  of  England  Faculty  of

<!-- image -->

Environment and Technology Research Ethics Committee (FET.21.10.011). The research was carried out in line with the UKRI Concordat to Support Research  Integrity,  and  complied  with  the  ethics  policies  of  the  two  lead universities  -  University  of  the  West  of  England  (to  January  2022)  and University of Glasgow (from January 2022).

While  the  defence  sector  produces  and  consumes  globally,  this  study focussed  on  the  United  States  (US)  and  the  United  Kingdom  as  they  are the two most prolific defence exporting countries on a rolling 10-year basis (DFiT, 2020). They are also high consumers of military equipment and very active operationally, with the US currently first and the UK fifth in terms of national military spending compared to other nations globally (SIPRI 2021). The US military alone emits more CO2e (carbon-dioxide equivalent) than that  of  most  nation  states  (Belcher et  al .  2020)  and  is  the  single  largest institutional  consumer  of  hydrocarbons  globally  (Bigger  and  Neimark 2017).  With  regard  to  the  UK,  calculations  of  GHG  emissions  by  sector indicate that the military-industrial sector has larger direct emissions than nine other sectors, including plastics; vehicles; glass and ceramics; and water and waste management (Parkinson 2020a).

The project included undertaking a literature review, document analysis, semi-structured  interviews  with  defence  sector  workers,  and  focus  group discussions with defence sector worker representatives and relevant 'experts'. The  literature  review  sources  included  databases,  reference  lists,  library searches, grey literature and internet search engines. The document analysis phase looked at relevant policy documents, media reports and websites in line with recognised protocols (e.g. Bowen 2009).

The interviews with the  defence  sector  workers  in  the  US  and  UK  discussed their aspirations, concerns and ideas in relation to the decarbonisation of the defence sector and its wider transition to sustainability. 'Defence sector  workers'  were defined,  for  the  purposes  of  this  study,  as  those  who work(ed) in the defence sector or for a company that supplies the defence sector, including military and civil service defence sector workers. In total, 58 workers were interviewed (30 in the UK and 28 in the US), mostly online or by  telephone  due  to  Covid  restrictions.  We  continued  to  recruit  a  diverse range of interviewees until we reached the point of 'data saturation'. More than 200 large and small organisations were approached including defence sector companies; the main trade unions that include defence sector workers in  each  country;  defence  interest  organisations,  including  US  Military,  US Airforce, Defence Forum, and Defence and Security Portal Facebook groups; veteran organisations, including Veterans for Peace in the US and UK; and environmental  voluntary  sector  groups  and  NGOs.  Participants  were recruited through an advert which was uploaded to social media, placed in company  newsletters  and  snowballed  via  email  contacts,  including  cold contacts, to the above  organisations. The  advert asked prospective

participants to contact the research team if they were interested in participating.  'Snowball  sampling'  has  been  criticised  for  relying  too  heavily  on single networks and adding to confirmation bias. However, the method was useful  for  accessing  hard-to-reach  workers  where  trust  is  a  factor.  The weaknesses  can  be  somewhat  offset  by  adding  several  starting  points (Bloch and McKay 2016) and so we accessed participants via a wide range of groups and contacts.

The  broad  demographics  of  the  sample  were:  Over  40 years  of  age (n35),  under  40  (n23);  men  (n47),  women  (n11);  white  nationals  (n48), Black,  Asian,  Minority  Ethnic  (n9),  not  identifying  (n1);  senior  managers  (n6),  other  workers  (n52).  For  a  more  nuanced  breakdown  of  the sample,  see  the  project  reports.  It  is  not  clear  whether  this  sample  is representative  of  the  sector  as  a  whole  as  there  is  no  demographic breakdown  of  the  entire  sector  and  limited  information  on  parts  of  it. Defence workers might be assumed to be predominantly male, given the sectoral  dominance  of  traditionally  male  employment  domains,  such  as engineering.

Questions included, for example:

- ● Are you aware of any policies or plans for decarbonisation/diversification/Just Transition that might apply to your type of work?
- ● How do you think these policies or plans will impact on yourself/your family/your workplace/your community?

We also held two online focus group discussions with a further 18 participants, all representing large organisations with many thousands of members. These groups included key representatives and leaders from defence companies,  relevant  national  government  departments,  academics,  NGOs  and trade unions. Hence, the individual workers were interviewed separately, and these organisational representatives made up the two focus groups. We did not monitor the demographic composition of the focus groups as these were all 'expert' members representing the most relevant organisations.

We  analysed  the  interviews  and  focus  groups  thematically  using  the Framework  Method  (Ritchie  and  Lewis  2003).  The  themes  were  decided upon  on  the  basis  of  discussions  among  the  researchers  and  advisory board, as well as being derived from the literature review and directly from the transcripts during the coding process. We did not compare the US and the UK data as we had small samples which could not represent the views of each nation's defence workers. Despite the samples not being large enough for us to generalise about defence sector workers, we were able gain a number of  insights. A stronger evidence base for discussion and recommendations was  developed  through  triangulating  this  primary  data  with  the  literature review and document analysis.

## Interviews and focus groups

As the JT literature might predict, there were very different views among the workers and defence experts about what a Just Transition should include, with  some  focussing  primarily  on  technical  change,  some  on  behavioural change, and others on more transformational systemic and political change. Here we focus on their discussion of the transformational change required and their views in relation to the political and economic factors that were driving unsustainability.

Contrary  to  the  'treadmill  of  destruction'  and  'growth  coalition' hegemonies,  some  of  the  workers  interviewed  discussed  the  possibility of  there  being  a  more  focused  defence  sector  with  reductions  in weapons  production  and  military  operations.  For  example,  the  following  participants,  while  very  committed  to  the  necessity  for  defence, brought  up  questions  of  limits,  ethics  and  priorities,  as  in  the  following  comments:

. . . I do think that the military and the defence sector do get involved in some things that either they shouldn't, or that they should not prioritise as much as they are. One example would be investment in arms in Saudi Arabia. I'm not in agreement with that . . . Defence should always be a last resort. That's kind of the point really (UK002: male, white, current government defence service).

Do  we  really  need  any  more  weapons?  I  don't  think  I  can  answer  that  . . . I think we do need, given the current state of play with the world, I think we do need some kind of defence but, in the same token, are we producing too much? (UK005: female, white, current government defence service).

. . . let's say we send a flotilla of ships across the world as a publicity exercise. Would we do that if we really looked at the carbon involved in doing that and pollution involved in it? Maybe we would question it a little bit more if there was a culture more akin to looking after the environment (UK008: male, black, current government defence service).

Some voiced counter-hegemonic arguments in favour of more drastic reductions in production and operations, questioning the relative social value of defence, as these workers argued:

Just green-washing isn't going to do it. Just putting solar panels up isn't going to do it. So, we're trying to stress that the only way to really lower emissions of the military is you've got to make the military smaller . . . Why don't we take those resources and use them someplace else where they really should be? (US008: male, white, ex-military).

I  would  like  to  reduce  the  whole  defence  sector  to  decarbonise  it.  . . .  the thought of  biofuels  being  used  for  tanks  is  so  insane  I  can't  believe  anyone suggested it, less food and more fuel for tanks I mean it's . . . I think it [the defence sector] will do anything to keep the whole show on the road, actually (UK019: male, white, ex-military, current defence manufacturing).

While these two workers were accessed via the Veterans for Peace organisation, similar views were voiced by other participants. Related to this, some of the  interviewees  spoke  about  how  the  money  spent  on  defence  could  be better  used  to  meet  human  needs  and  address  the  causes  of  war  as,  for example, in the following statements:

So,  if  we  weren't  spending  as  much  [on  defence]  or  if  we  were  taking  that money and putting it towards social needs, those could have a great impact on the quality of life for most Americans in terms of stuff like national healthcare and a lot of the safety net things that, say, most countries in Europe take for granted because they don't spend as much money on weaponry as we do . . . (US011: male, white, current defence manufacturing).

. . . I suppose the biggest one is the amount of resources that are taken up . . . taking up enormous amounts of resources that could be transferred to mitigating the causes of war

(UK019: male, white, ex-military, current defence manufacturing).

These  views  suggest  support  for  a  transformational  vision  of  JT,  questioning  the  value  of  what  is  produced  and  focusing  on  contributing  to societal benefits. However, others made it clear that they did not want to consider  reducing  the  defence  sector  or  military.  These  were  strongly opposed  to  decreasing  military  production  and  replacing  with  civil production,  arguing  that  the  defence  sector  was  essential  to  be  able respond  to  known  unknown  threats,  as  in  the  following  comments:

The entire reason of defence is to protect the nation. . . if we diversified from defence, . . . we would basically have no defence. We would lose our capabilities in order to defend ourselves and our interests both at home and abroad (UK002: male, white, current government defence service).

. . . a strong defence is what you have to have in order to show the world that you can take them on, and the United States . . . some people would like to call it 'the protectors of the world' . . .

(US007: female, white, current defence manufacturing).

From one of the focus groups, a sustainability manager at an international defence company, argued that:

- . . .  I  think  it's  really  important  that  we  remember  that  defence  is  about defending our way our life and we can't achieve what we want to . . . if, actually, we're not able to maintain, as democratic nations, where we have freedom of speech. For me that's what defence is about. Defence, not attack.

Hence,  alongside  the  counter-hegemonic  views,  identifying  the  need  for a fundamental transformation of the section, were these notions of defence as  a  means  of  securing  peace  and  freedom  (see  further  testimonies  in  the project transcripts).

## Barriers to transformation

Those  who  expressed  a  wider  and  more  transformative  vision  were, however, aware of the barriers to achieving this. They discussed the profit motive under capitalism, the power of the defence sector, their close links with  government,  offshoring  to  circumvent  regulations  and  a  lack  of workplace  democracy.  For  example,  some  of  those  interviewed  discussed company  desire  to  maximise  profit  as  a  barrier,  as  in  the  following statements:

- . . .  it's  a  very  lucrative  business  for  a  start.  I  mean,  I  think  when  you  have a permanent arms industry that has to make lots of money and sell arms then you're going to have a dynamic to fight wars

(UK019: male, white, ex-military, current defence manufacturing).

. . .  there's  people  who  live  off  war  and  war  based  industries  and  you  would have to overcome that barrier . . . If you can convince them, I think, that they could make as much money in another field, that would be the barrier that would have to be broken

(US013: female, white, current defence manufacturing union leader).

They recognised that scaling back operations would be difficult because of the  power of the defence sector, their close relationship with government, and the lobbying they were involved in, as discussed here.:

Well, the major barrier is this, for Trident, the only reason they have got it they can't use it because if they used it, you would be talking the annihilation of civilisation - the only reason they have got it is to keep a seat at the top table of the Security Council at the UN and it's a political thing. It's no' really a defence weapon, it's a macho thing. Britain is still the imperial power, or it thinks it is . . . (UK020: male, white, ex-military).

I  always  revert  back  to  lobbyists  because  they're  the  ones  controlling  our politicians.  If  we  can  somehow  take  the  money  out  of  the  voting  system  in the States, then we'll take the power away from lobbyists. . . . We're under the guise of a lot of propaganda, unfortunately. (US019: male, black, ex-military).

Linked  to  this  lobbying  power  of  the  defence  companies,  some  workers interviewed  felt  that  diversification  was  unlikely  to  happen  because  of  the government subsidies involved in defence, as discussed here:

. . . the defence industry, from my point of view, is essentially a magic money tree. There is always money available no matter what you do and so . . . they almost need to be made less dependent on that to make them do other things (UK022: male, white, current defence manufacturing).

. . .  defence  work  is  essentially  state  run.  It's  a  state  run  industry  and  the majority  of  the  funding  is  through  the  taxpayer.  . . .  they  don't  care  where their money comes from as long as they make their money. So, if they can see the same type of profit margin through renewable energy then maybe they will invest as much in that as they have in aviation in the past, but the problem is

<!-- image -->

with defence work it's kind of like a blank cheque (US015: male, white, current defence manufacturing).

It  was  generally  considered  that  there  was  a  lack  of  democracy  around sustainability in relation to the defence sector. The majority of those interviewed had not been consulted on decarbonisation, Just Transition or other sustainability plans and some did not feel they could speak freely about their views on this, as discussed here:

. . . in the civil service as well as the military, you don't want to upset your boss, because your boss is God and has the ability to make or break a career, so that means that people don't tend to push their passions quite so much (UK011: female, white, current government defence service).

While the workers interviewed were concerned about job losses arising from outsourcing and automation, they generally expressed few concerns about job  losses  occurring  in  the  defence  sector  as  a  result  of  the  transition  to sustainability. However, some were concerned that more stringent environmental policies can increase operating costs with the result that companies, in order to maintain their profits, relocate some or all of their operations to low-regulation regions or countries, as discussed in this excerpt:

I think companies are outsourcing work to places where they don't have to be environmentally responsible and they can get cheap labour and that puts a lot of people in harm's way overall which contributes, I think, to global warming, to pollution, to things that limit people's access to quality water, quality air and just their general health and safety

(US013: female, white, current defence manufacturing union leader).

Hence,  some  of  the  interviewees  argued  that  what  is  needed  is  a  more structural  understanding  of  the  defence  sector  in  relation  to  the  climate and  other  environmental  crises,  focussing  on  the  economic  system  constraining what decisions can be made. They felt a more transformative vision of  JT  was  required  to  address  these  issues,  considering  the  technical approaches to JT to be 'green washing'.

## Achieving a transformative just transition

Those  interviewees  that  were  involved  in  their  labour  union  felt  the  way forward would be to take collective action, via the unions, in order to have greater influence on their companies and workplace with regard to JT. A key message from the focus groups was that social dialogue with workers and their  communities  will  be  important  for  achieving  JT.  Within  the  focus groups,  it  was  also  argued  that  a  shift  in  industrial  policy  was  required, away  from  a  military-industrial  policy  towards  one  that  focused  on  the

<!-- image -->

national security threat of climate change. For example, an NGO representative stated:

I believe that a large part of military spending in, not just the UK or the US, but in  a  lot  of  major  countries,  is  not  actually  contributing  to  our  real  security needs; that it's not simply about defending democracy from attack. Too much of it is about making, or being prepared to make, military interventions as an attempt to solve political problems which have usually turned out disastrously over  the  last  20 years.  . . .  Also,  a  lot  of  defence  production  . . .  is  not  for defending themselves but for export. Our biggest customer is Saudi Arabia. Arms exported to Saudi Arabia are definitely not about defending democracy.

Addressing  questions  of  outsourcing  to  avoid  social  and  environmental regulation, the trade union representatives in the focus groups also discussed how they have been working at making sure that global supply chains are run in a way which doesn't undermine workers' basic rights.

Transformational views of JT, therefore, permeated the discussions with workers and their representatives, as well as some of the NGOs, indicating the seeds of a new cultural hegemony in relation to the treadmill of destruction  and  the  growth  coalition.  Yet  the  workers  and  others  were  generally clear that the struggle to overcome these barriers would be immense.

## Analysis

It  has  been  argued  that  labour's  focus  on  economic  material  gains,  while important  for  improving  lives  and  capturing  more  political  power,  has 'tended  to  lock  the  working  class  within  a  political  horizon  limited  to maintaining the same system' (Velicu and Barca 2020, p. 267). Yet here we see  that  some  defence  sector  workers  were  looking  beyond  the  growth coalition and treadmill of destruction. This indicates the opportunities that are  opening  up  for  social  transformation  which  can  coalesce  around  the concept of JT.

For some of these workers, to effectively transition to sustainability would mean taking on the power of the defence companies and the capitalist system itself that appears to be driving irrational production. They called for more emphasis on 'human security', as opposed to 'national security' and argued that only a transformational JT would be effective as it addresses the causes of  unsustainability. They were also alert to the militarism and nationalism that justifies the sector making it a greater struggle to shift towards sustainability. Such an analysis points to the need for a counter-hegemonic alliance to take on their economic and political power.

It  may  be  that  those  that  wanted  a  reduced  or  more  focussed  defence sector and those that saw the barriers as political and economic may not be as few as might be assumed, since they are evident even in this small sample, including  among  some  current  defence  sector  workers.  Given  the  sample

<!-- image -->

size,  we  cannot  make  correlations  with  demographics  or  affiliations  that would help us explain why some current defence workers appeared to have a  more  transformative  vision.  A  quantitative  survey  engaging  many  more participants  could  follow  up  on  this  question,  exploring  some  hypotheses arising from our study findings, such as active engagement in trade unionism, more skilled occupations, and stronger commitments to environmentalism,  as  potential  variables.  In  particular,  our  analysis  suggests  that  those workers with a more transformative vision had always had some reservations about their jobs but were drawn to defence because of a lack of alternative employment. For example, UK022 and US013 explained:

I am uncomfortable working in the defence industry at large so I am looking to make that move already because I'd  rather  be  working for  a  business  that's good for the planet rather than what I would really see as bad

(UK022: male, white, current defence manufacturing).

. . . one of the reasons that I didn't wanna come to work at [ANONYMISED defence  company]  was  because  of  the  defence  industry.  I  didn't  wanna work  in  a  factory  and  I  didn't  wanna  work  in  something  that  supported making  machines  of  war  . . .  I  would  be  happy  to  lose  this  job  and  find another. And if it was in a renewable resource, research or job that would be fantastic

(US013: female, white, current defence manufacturing union leader).

Being  an  ex-defence  worker  seemed  to  make  it  easier  to  express  counterhegemonic  views,  but  some  current  workers  were  able  to  cope  with  the cognitive dissonance of needing to do work that didn't align with their values because  they  felt  their  employment  choices  had  been  constrained  by  the availability  of  work.  This  chimes  with  the  conclusions  of  Levy  and  Egan (2003, p. 813) who note that workers will have different perspectives, some self-contradictory, in part because of 'the capacity of agents to comprehend social structures and effect change, while simultaneously being constructed and constrained by them'. It should also be noted that the interviews for this project took place before the Russian armed intervention in Ukraine. Given that UK and US societies are highly militarised (see, for example, Kelly 2023) and are the largest providers of military equipment to Ukraine (Mills 2023), the  dominant  discourse  currently  is  for  increased  defence  spending  to counter external threats.

It  is  difficult  to  say  the  extent  to  which  workers in other sectors will be interested in a transformative JT. Clearly, different industries and sectors will have different priorities. Some sectors will grow in the transition, such as rare earth elements and wind energy, requiring a focus on regulating associated harms  (Sadan et  al .  2022)  and  worker  rights  (e.g.  Schulte et  al .  2022), respectively.  It  may  be  that,  where  jobs  are  immediately  at  risk,  the  focus needs to be on the narrower conception of JT as it has been, for example, in

relation to coal (Galgóczi 2019). Since the workers interviewed here were not fearing job losses in relation to the transition to sustainability, perhaps they were  more  able  to  focus  on  the  wider  issues  and  to  consider  preferable employment,  rather  than  clinging  on  to  what  they  have.  It  is  clear  that there will be 'varieties of Just Transitions' reflecting the varying industries, contexts  and  societies  (Galgóczi  2020).  However,  as  Abram et  al .  (2022) argue, a narrow, sectoral approach may not address wider aspects of justice. There  are  many  interlinkages  and  overlaps  across  sectors,  including  the defence sector,  and all sectors  could play  a  part  in  a  transformative  JT,  as appropriate to particular contexts.

## Conclusion

Hence, there are competing ideas of JT within the defence sector and some of these ideas challenge hegemonic notions of what the transition to sustainability will involve. Defence sector workers, historically tending to support the growth of the sector (Brenes, 2014), would appear to be an unlikely group to argue for a transformative approach. As such, the study suggests it may be possible to begin to organise for a new cultural hegemony that could be built around  the  idea  of  a  transformative  Just  Transition.  However,  given  the barriers to achieving this, a counter-hegemonic coalition will be necessary, joining with other workers, as well as peace and justice NGOs.

A transformative JT within the defence sector would mean worker dialogue around JT with all options on the table, including a discussion of arms conversion to socially useful production. It would mean building solidarity with,  and  including  the  perspectives  of,  workers  in  the  Global  South  and other relatively lower income regions who are supplying the defence sector and, in some cases, have suffered the impacts of war and colonialism led by the  Global North. It would include focusing agendas and budgets on supporting a 'human security' approach to foreign policy, addressing global and national poverty, inequality, health and environmental crises and investing in the jobs that would accompany implementing this agenda.

This  focus  on  the  defence  sector  echoes  the  wider  debates  around how  to  transition  to  sustainability  and  the  degree  to  which  this  can occur  within  the  current  capitalist  political  economy.  It  also  highlights the  difficulty  of  transitioning  given  the  power  of  companies  and  their close association  with  the  state and  military  in  capitalist society. However, the study also helps us to see where hope might lie - through supporting  workers  that  are  challenging  the  hegemonic  discourses  and practices on transitioning to sustainability, including trade union endeavours  to  establish  international  solidarity  around  JT,  improving  workplace  democracy  and  engaging  the  public  with  new  understandings  of social  and  environmental  problems.  We see  all  this  happening  currently

in  the  UK  with  a  surge  in  union  membership  interest  (ITV  2022)  and industrial  action  (Wall  2022),  particularly  through  the  work  of  the  rail workers  union,  the  RMT  (Rail,  Maritime  and  Transport),  where  their leaders  are  being  held  up  as  heroes  for  simply  saying  that  services  are being  organised  around  the  drive  for  profit,  rather  than  social  and environmental  wellbeing.  This  is  also  the  message  from  some  of  these defence sector workers. Through  further  collective action around a  transformational  vision  of  JT,  they  may  be  able  to  break  the  treadmill of  destruction.
