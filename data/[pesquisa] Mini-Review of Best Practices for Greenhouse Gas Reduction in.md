Abstract: Climate change is an urgent global concern driven by human activities and the subsequent rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The semiconductor industry has emerged as a significant contributor to GHG emissions, yet there is a lack of clear guidelines for effective reduction methods specifically tailored to domestic and international semiconductor manufacturing. This mini-review addresses this gap by proposing implementation principles for optimal control technology aimed at mitigating GHG emissions in the semiconductor industry. Drawing upon guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and established reduction methods, our focus is on the deployment of efficient exhaust gas destruction equipment for removing GHGs from critical processes such as Etching, ThinFilm (including chemical/physical vapor deposition), and Diffusion. By examining and consolidating current best practices, this review provides a foundation for developing comprehensive guidelines and standards that support the semiconductor industry's transition to more sustainable operations. Considering the vast body of literature in this field, we highlight the significance of this study as it contributes to the ongoing research efforts in reducing GHG emissions. The objective of this study is to identify research gaps and motivate further investigations, while also providing practical recommendations for reducing GHG emissions in the semiconductor industry.

## 1. Introduction

With the global objective of achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050, the semiconductor industry plays a crucial role in addressing climate change. As a leading semiconductor manufacturing company in Singapore, our focus on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions aligns with the industry's commitment to sustainable practices. In line with the Scientific Basis-Based Targets (SBTi), many semiconductor fabs in Singapore have set annual carbon emission reduction targets of 3-4% [1]. To meet these targets, various strategies have been implemented, including the accelerated installation of local scrubbers, the promotion of energy-saving equipment and measures, and the adoption of green electricity equipment. Singapore, as a nation, is actively working towards reducing GHG emissions and has set baseline targets for carbon reduction. In this context, the semiconductor industry in Singapore aims to achieve an emission rate of less than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (t/CO2e) by 2023 [2], as per the baseline established by the National Environment Agency. To achieve this goal, advanced control technology is being implemented across different phases of semiconductor manufacturing [2,3]. The methodology employed for reducing

## 2. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategies in the Semiconductor Industry

The semiconductor industry plays a vital role in technological advancements and innovation, but it is also recognized as one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [8]. As the urgency to address climate change grows, there is a pressing need to identify and implement effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions in semiconductor manufacturing processes [9]. This comprehensive literature review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge and best practices related to GHG reduction in the semiconductor industry, with a specific focus on Singapore [10]. The current literature review on GHG reduction in the semiconductor industry provides a comprehensive overview of the state of knowledge and best practices in this field. The novelty of this study lies in its specific focus on the semiconductor industry in Singapore, which allows for a detailed examination of the strategies and initiatives implemented in a specific context.

The review also identifies greenhouse gas substitution as a key strategy for reducing net fluorine-gas emissions in the semiconductor industry. The novelty here lies in the evaluation of alternative gases that not only have lower global warming potential (GWP) but also meet the performance and operational requirements of semiconductor manufacturing processes. This assessment considers potential safety and health impacts on fab operations, employee protection, and external environmental impacts.

## 2.1. Greenhouse Gas Substitution-Phase 1

To further reduce net fluorine-gas emissions in the semiconductor industry, one approach is to replace gases with high global warming potential (GWP) with alternatives that have lower GWP or no GWP. This substitution strategy aims to use gases more efficiently in the plasma process [11]. The gases of particular concern in this context are CF4, C2F6, C3F8, c-C4F8, CHF3, CH2F2, CH3F, NF3, and SF6. These gases have significant GWP values and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. CF4 is commonly used in both Etching and

ThinFilm processes, while CHF3, CH2F2, and C2F6 are also used in various semiconductor manufacturing processes [12,13].

When considering alternative chemicals for substitution, it is essential to evaluate their potential safety and health impacts on fab operations, employee protection, and external environmental impacts [8]. The objective is to identify replacement gases that not only offer lower GWP but also maintain the desired performance and operational requirements of the semiconductor manufacturing processes. Table 1 summarizes the GWP values, byproducts, and noteworthy remarks for the relevant gas categories. These values are based on the Carbon Pricing Act 2018 (CPA 2018) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2019 assessment [1,2]. It is important to note that CF4, C2F6, and CHF3 are frequently mentioned due to their significant GWP and their presence as by-products in various semiconductor processes [14].

Through the Greenhouse Gas Substitution-Phase 1, semiconductor manufacturers can make informed decisions regarding the replacement of high GWP gases with alternatives that have a lower environmental impact. This phase requires careful consideration of the gases' performance, safety implications, and overall reduction potential in greenhouse gas emissions [8,15].

## 2.2. Advanced Abatement Methodology-Phase 2

The semiconductor industry has developed and commercialized various advanced abatement technologies to reduce fluorine-gas emissions effectively. The focus has been on implementing abatement systems (Figure 1) near the emission source to prevent further contamination and dilution of the gases [9,10].

This approach involves connecting each emission stream to a local scrubber, enabling accurate calculations of FC emissions [9,10]. The connection method between the production system and the abatement system is crucial for achieving precise emission measurements. Venting equipment and process conditions, such as the temperature, fluorinated greenhouse gas inlet concentration, flow rate, pump purge rate, and total inlet flow composition, significantly impact the performance of the venting system [11,12].

The combustion-based abatement system involves the installation of efficient combustion-based systems that effectively remove FCs and N2O. Similarly, the electric-based abatement system utilizes electric-based technologies for emission reduction. Plasma-based abatement systems leverage plasma technology to remove FCs and N2O. Additionally, other methods, such as UV-based systems, may be employed for FC and N2O abatement. The primary objective of these abatement methods is to reduce the emissions of specific greenhouse gases, including CF4, C2F6, C3F8, c-C4F8, CHF3, CH2F2, CH3F, NF3, and SF6.

Process optimization plays a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas consumption and minimizing fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions in semiconductor manufacturing. By modifying process variables such as chamber pressure, temperature, plasma power, cleaning gas flow rate, gas flow time, and gas ratio, it is possible to decrease carbon emissions [6]. Process improvement techniques, including endpoint inspection systems utilizing mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, optical emission spectroscopy, and radio frequency impedance monitoring, provide valuable data for optimizing processes [7]. These techniques have been extensively used for cleaning chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chambers, and they can also be applied to Etching and other fluorinated greenhouse gas plasma operations.

Remote Plasma Cleaning System-Phase 4

## 2.4. Remote Plasma Cleaning System-Phase 4 Remote plasma cleaning technology has emerged as an alternative to in situ CVD

Remote plasma cleaning technology has emerged as an alternative to in situ CVD chamber cleaning. In this approach, a plasma generation unit is installed at the front of the CVD chamber, facilitating the cleaning process [6]. The plasma unit initiates the reaction of NF3, generating fluorine radicals and ions that chemically react with the deposited material in the processing chamber (Figure 2) [13]. The by-products of this reaction, such as SiF4, are then carried away in gaseous form. Remote plasma cleaning systems can be retrofitted into existing processing tools to replace the original chemistry used for fluorine gas cleaning [14]. Continuous evaluation and sharing of new technologies within the semiconductor industry are essential for further improvement [15]. It is crucial to follow reliable measurement protocols when measuring emissions or assessing the effectiveness of new technologies [16]. chamber cleaning.

## 2.5. Basis of Preparation and Monitoring Plan-Endorsed by ISO14064 and NEA

The basis of preparation (BoP) and monitoring plan (MP) for GHG reduction initiatives in the semiconductor industry are rooted in the 'IPCC 2019 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 3, Chapter 6' (IPCC GL) and the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. Estimation methods based on these guidelines provide a framework for calculating emissions, aligning with the objectives and requirements set forth by environmental agencies such as the National Environment Agency (NEA) [7,17]. Adherence to the ISO 14064 standard ensures that GHG reduction efforts in the semiconductor industry comply with internationally recognized protocols [16].

To conclude, this comprehensive literature review has highlighted the current state of knowledge and best practices for GHG reduction in the semiconductor industry. Through greenhouse gas substitution, advanced abatement methodologies, process optimization, and the use of remote plasma cleaning systems, significant progress has been made in reducing emissions of fluorinated compounds and N2O gases.

Further research and development efforts are essential to continue advancing GHG reduction strategies in the semiconductor industry, ultimately contributing to global sustainability goals. Moreover, this literature review also contributes to the existing knowledge by providing insights into the specific strategies and initiatives implemented in the semiconductor industry in Singapore. The novelty of the study lies in its focus on greenhouse gas substitution, advanced abatement methodologies, process optimization, remote plasma cleaning systems, and adherence to standardized monitoring protocols.

## 3. Methodology for Developing Implementation Principles of Optimal Control Technology

3.1. Overview of the Control Technology Methodology

## 3.1.1. Old Control Technology

Early PFC abatement systems were not effective in destroying CF4 because of its strong C-F molecular bonds. Burn boxes operating at temperatures of 800 degrees Celsius were only up to 27% effective in destroying PFCs. Many times, the destruction of CHF3, C2F6, and C3F8 generated CF4 from the decomposition of the original gases [7]. The semiconductor manufacturing emission factors include fluorinated compounds (FCs) that are not destroyed by the emission reduction system; CO2 generated as a by-product of the reduction of F-GHGs; CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuels in the emission reduction system; and CO2 from electricity use during the operation of the emission reduction system. In the monitoring procedure, the gas concentration at the inlet and outlet of the abatement system will be monitored continuously using two FTIR devices, and the gas velocity at the inlet and outlet of the abatement system will be monitored continuously as well [8,10,13].

The monitoring methodology specifies that the mass of each F-GHG entering and leaving the abatement unit, as well as the inlet and outlet flow rates, should be calculated separately and continuously. The relevant parameters required for the calculation of baseline and project emissions shall be monitored continuously [14]. All measurements shall be carried out using equipment calibrated according to the relevant industry standards.] In addition to following the QA/QC procedures for measuring gas concentrations as described in the baseline chapter and the QA/QC procedures for measuring flows in the US EPA methodology, the project developer should ensure that maintenance and repair procedures follow, at a minimum, the manufacturer's recommendations or the requirements specified in this methodology throughout the monitoring period. A record of the maintenance requirements for the monitoring and abatement equipment should be submitted to the verifier [16].

## 3.1.2. New Reduction Method

The new methodology is not only applicable to the Etching process, the ThinFilm process, which includes chemical/physical vapor deposition, and Diffusion processes but also to the semiconductor process where FCs and N2O and NF3 greenhouse gases are emitted directly into the atmosphere and can also be implied such reduction program. Still, post-production plants should have a history of fluorinated and N2O greenhouse gas use and utilization rates for three consecutive years prior to the start of the project year; post-production new plants should have a history of fluorinated and N2O greenhouse gas use and utilization rates for two consecutive years prior to the start of the project year of the installation of the proper abatement system [14-16]. The maximum processing capacity of the abatement must be greater than the historical data on the flow of FCs, N2O, and NF3 greenhouse gases into the abatement (including all other by-products and diluted gases). The reduction project should also assess that the lifespan of the abatement system is greater than the project period, and existing equipment that fails due to its age can no longer be used in the case of this method; the removal of equipment has been a previous project in reduction measures and can no longer apply for this method [19].

Fluorinated compounds and the N2O greenhouse gas usage rate must be the amount of gas used (tons of CO2e) and wafer production area (m 2 ) for the installation of exhaust gas destruction treatment equipment, and the wafer size is defined according to the financial annual report of wafer move, including 5 ′′ , 6 ′′ , 8 ′′ , 12 ′′ , 18 ′′ wafers, etc. The various types of GHGs are requested to follow the global warming potential (GWP) gases announced by US EPA [20].

The comparative table (Table 3) highlights the key differences between the old control technology and the new reduction method. The old control technology was found to have limited effectiveness in destroying CF4, a greenhouse gas with strong molecular bonds. The abatement systems operating at high temperatures were only up to 27% effective in destroying fluorinated compounds (FCs). Additionally, the monitoring in the old control technology relied on the gas concentration and velocity measurements at the inlet and outlet of the abatement system. In contrast, the new reduction method is applicable to various processes and direct emissions of FCs, N2O, and NF3. It takes into account the complete emission stream through the implementation of a SCADA system, enabling the monitoring of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The new reduction method also emphasizes the need for a high destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of the abatement system, with a requirement of over 90% for most types of treatment equipment. Furthermore, the calculation of gas usage rates in the new reduction method considers the amount of gas used and the wafer production area, taking into account different wafer sizes. This approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of GHG emissions. Additionally, the new reduction method requires the abatement system's lifespan to be greater than the project period, ensuring long-term effectiveness and sustainability.

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| Monitoring         | Gas concentration and velocity monitoring            | SCADA system for total GHG monitoring                |
| Baseline Data      | Historical data required for assessment              | Historical data required for assessment              |
| Abatement System   | Less than 27% destruction efficiency for PFCs        | DRE &gt; 90% (combustion, electric, or plasma type)     |
| Gas Usage Rate     | Not destroyed by emission reduction system           | Gas usage rate calculation based on production area  |
| Equipment Lifespan | N/A                                                  | Abatement system lifespan &gt; project period           |
| Compliance         | Follows industry standards and QA/QC procedures      | Compliance with IPCC and US EPA guidelines           |

It is important to note that the new reduction method complies with international guidelines such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandatory reporting rules. This ensures that the methodology aligns with industry standards and best practices for GHG emissions reduction.

## 3.2. Important Features of the New Reduction Methods

This method is applicable to the integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing industry. Other targets including semiconductor materials (including chemicals), photomasks, design (including Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software), manufacturing processes, packaging, testing, and equipment may not be applicable to this method. The effectiveness of the damage removal rate of the installed abatement system, which is normally the local scrubber connected to the manufacturing modules, must be considered and referred to the IPCC

Processes and US EPA Mandatory Reporting Rule [21]. Moreover, the destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of the treatment equipment should be greater than 90% (combustion, electric, or plasma type). The DRE of the N2O treatment equipment should be greater than 60%, and the used local scrubbers purchased by external companies should be tested upon completion of installation [22].

2023

The new methodology is such that a facility SCADA system would be connected to the emission stream where the total amount of GHG would be monitored. The pressure transducer is installed for the whole production and abatement process to clean the emission stream for cleaning chemical vapor deposition module tool chambers. The local scrubbers are used to treat the GHG so that less will be emitted into the atmosphere. The process can be seen in Figure 3. 9  of  15

## 4. Proposed Principles and Applicability in the Singapore Semiconductor Industry

In this chapter, we further enhance the understanding of the proposed principles for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in the semiconductor industry, with a focus on their applicability to the context of Singapore. We also consider important factors related to monitoring, calculation methodology, and implementation considerations for new reduction methods. By incorporating these additional aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing in Singapore.

## 4.1. Proposed Principles for GHG Reduction

The previously discussed principles for GHG reduction remain relevant, but we now emphasize the implementation of best control technologies for fluorine-gas, PFCs, and HFCs reduction in semiconductor fabs. These technologies have proven effective in reducing emissions and align with the goals set by the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and the TSIA Semiconductor Fluorine Gas Emission Reduction BAT Implementation Principles. To achieve the desired reduction targets, it is crucial to establish a standard emission rate (NER) and set specific reduction goals. For instance, the WSC expects a 30% reduction in NER, equivalent to a standard emission rate of 0.22 kgCO2e/cm 2 by 2020, based on the 2010 total baseline. Furthermore, the TSIA aligns with the WSC resolution and ensures the implementation of reduction techniques in emission reporting and new plants, including those outside the WSC region.

Additionally, the calculation approach for estimating emissions and by-products should follow the 'IPCC 2019 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use: Chapter 6 Electronics Industry Emission, Tier 2c' formula. This formula takes into account parameters such as the number of fluorinated compounds used, emission factors, destruction rates, creation of by-products, and their corresponding global warming potentials.

## 4.2. Monitoring Plans and Calculation Approach

To facilitate effective monitoring and reporting, a Monitoring Plan (MP) must be prepared and maintained by corporations exceeding the total GHG emission threshold. The MPshould include details on the facility's GHG emission sources and streams, emission quantification methods, quality management procedures, and uncertainty assessment. The NEA's guidelines and the MP Template provide guidance on the key elements to document in the MP, including site details, metering and analysis, emission streams, summary tables, and quality management frameworks [24].

The calculation approach should consider the specific parameters outlined in the Tier 2c formula, as detailed in Table 4. This includes recording data on gas and chemical consumption sourced from facility SCADA systems and wafer move data from modules CIM systems. By accurately measuring and calculating emissions, semiconductor manufacturers can gain insights into their performance and progress towards GHG reduction goals.

## 4.3. Implementation Considerations for New Reduction Methods

The implementation of new reduction methods requires careful consideration of several factors. For post-production new plants, historical data on fluorinated and N2O usage and utilization rates for two consecutive years should be available before initiating the project. The abatement system's processing power must exceed past data on the passage of fluorinated compounds and N2O, including by-products and diluted gases. It is essential to ensure that the lifespan of the abatement system exceeds the project duration, and that existing equipment is in good working condition or replaced if necessary. Additionally, equipment that has been previously used in reduction measures should be removed to avoid redundancy and inefficiencies.

## 4.4. Applicability to the Singapore Semiconductor Industry

The proposed principles for GHG reduction and the considerations outlined above are highly applicable to the semiconductor industry in Singapore. Singapore's commitment to environmental sustainability, as reflected in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and the Green Plan 2030, aligns with these principles. The advanced infrastructure, strong regulatory frameworks, and collaboration between industry stakeholders create a conducive environment for the implementation of optimal control technologies and the adoption of sustainable practices. By embracing these principles and implementing effective reduction methods, the semiconductor industry in Singapore can lead the way in sustainable semiconductor manufacturing, contributing to national and global environmental goals while maintaining competitiveness in the global market [25].

## 4.5. Other Consideration Factors for the Implementation of New Reduction Methods

Prior to the start of the project year for the installation of an effective abatement system, post-production new plants shall have a history of fluorinated and N2O usage and utilization rates for two consecutive years. The abatement's maximum processing power must exceed past data on the passage of FCs and N2O into the abatement (including all other by-products and diluted gases). The reduction project must also determine whether the lifespan of the abatement system is longer than the project, whether existing equipment has failed or grown too old to be used, and remove equipment if it has been in a previous reduction measures project [19].

## 4.6. Example of Installing Emission Control Technology with High Destruction Efficiency for C2F6

An exemplary case of installing emission control technology with exceptional destruction efficiency for C2F6 can be illustrated using the following data:

- · FCg,used (Amount of C2F6 used) = 1000 kg.
- · Dg for abatement control (combustion/electric heating scrubber) = 0.9.
- · Dg for abatement control (wet scrubber) = 0.
- · GWP(Global Warming Potential) for C2F6 = 9200.

Applying the emission calculation equation Eg = FCg,used × {(1 -Cg) × [1 -(Ag × Dg)] × GWPg}, we can assess the remarkable impact of implementing emission control technology. With the installation of highly efficient abatement control technology, the total emission of C2F6 is calculated to be 2,539,200 kg CO2e. This impressive achievement signifies a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the effectiveness of the implemented control measures.

In stark contrast, in the absence of abatement control technology, the total emission of C2F6 amounts to a staggering 5,520,000 kg CO2e. This stark contrast emphasizes the significance of installing emission control technology with high destruction efficiency to mitigate environmental impact and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By successfully implementing such effective emission control measures, we not only demonstrate a commitment to environmental sustainability but also contribute significantly to the preservation of our planet. The substantial reduction achieved in C2F6 emissions showcases the positive outcomes that can be achieved when advanced control technologies are applied.

This exemplary case serves as a testament to the remarkable potential for environmental conservation through the adoption of cutting-edge emission control technology. By embracing such initiatives, we pave the way for a greener future and inspire others to follow suit in reducing their environmental footprint.
