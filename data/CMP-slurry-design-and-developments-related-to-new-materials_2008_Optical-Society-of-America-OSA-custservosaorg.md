Abstract: Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is recognized by the semiconductor industry as the technology of choice for eliminating local and global topographic variations on flat wafers. Several factors including a large number of input variables play a key role in controlling the CMP output parameters. One of the most important variables is the slurry composition which includes  chemical additives and abrasive particles. This talk will  provide a fundamental  basis for slurry design to control the CMP output parameters.
