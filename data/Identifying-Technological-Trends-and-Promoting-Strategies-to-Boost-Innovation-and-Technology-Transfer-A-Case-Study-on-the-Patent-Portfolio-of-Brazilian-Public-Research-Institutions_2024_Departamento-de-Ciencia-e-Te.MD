## INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXTUALIZATION

The development of new and innovative technologies represents a fundamental pillar for the economic and social progress of countries (Fujino and Stal 2007; Levin et al. 1987; Lima et al. 2019). Supporting this development are the economic appropriations of technologies, which ensure that inventors and institutions have exclusive rights over their inventions (Encaoua et al. 2006).

By protecting inventions, the aim is to create an environment conducive to technological development, where ideas can be developed and economically exploited without the risk of being improperly appropriated by others (Barbosa 2010). This stimulates investment in new research towards innovative solutions and creates a virtuous cycle of innovation and economic growth.

These rights are not just a recognition of the effort and investment in research and development (R&amp;D), but also a crucial mechanism for business strategies in the pursuit of competitive advantages, for improving the quality of life of people and for driving economic growth (OECD 2004).

In the complex process of research, development, and innovation (RD&amp;I), understanding the possible opportunities, both for future R&amp;D activities in research centers and for the industrial sector interested in incorporating and modernizing their industrial processes, developing and exploiting new products within their corporate strategies is a critical success factor.

In public scientific and technological institutions (STIs), the integration between technological development, protection of intellectual property (IP), and its transfer to the industrial sectors is, therefore, a strategic vector for the sustainable economic and technological development of countries, given their political objectives of creation and institutional operation.

In this context, governments, research institutions, and the productive sector must work together to create RD&amp;I policies and organizational structures that promote innovation, protect inventions, and facilitate the technology transfer (TT) process (Etzkowitz 2002).

This collaborative effort not only accelerates economic development, but also ensures that the benefits of innovation are shared across society, contributing to a more prosperous and sustainable future (Edquist 1997; Lundvall, 1992). Indeed, this guarantee is a principle of the Innovation Law N . 10.973/2004 (Brasil 2004). o

It is known that the dynamics of the TT process are determined by the peculiarities of a set of factors related both to the market itself and to the business environment in which research centers operate (Bozeman 2000). In this scenario, the technological issue is just one side of the prism where economic appropriations are embedded.

In the aerospace and defense sector, technologies are typically cutting-edge, featuring complex customized products and systems. These technologies are engineering-intensive, high-performance, high-cost, and high-value-added, and are considered strategic by the producing nations and companies (Becz et al. 2010; Carvalho 2011; Schmidt 2011). These technologies have a high potential for dual use and are of interest to various industrial sectors.

The STIs that are the focus of this study are all located in São José dos Campos, state of São Paulo, a recognized Brazilian hub for aerospace and defense development: the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), the Institute for Advanced Studies (IEAv), and the Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA). These public STIs perform teaching, research, and development activities to technologically support the needs of the agents in the innovation ecosystem and have robust competencies, derived from the high technical level of their professionals and diversified laboratory infrastructure, distributed in areas of knowledge essential for the aerospace and defense field. They execute a varied portfolio of RD&amp;I projects in advanced technologies of manifest strategic importance for the country.

This manuscript reflects on the RD&amp;I process in public technology-based STIs, considering the IP obtained by them, and explores emerging trends, knowledge gaps, the potential of TT from these IPs, and the dynamics of the innovation process in a diversified spectrum of industrial sectors. It focuses particularly focus on the areas of measurement instrumentation, testing, and navigation, among other significant technological sectors in which the STIs operate.

In doing so, the aim is not only to understand the trajectories of technological development, but also to anticipate the impacts of these trends on the economy (Campbell 1983; Kaminishi et al. 2014), on STIs, and on Brazilian society as a whole. This focus is relevant as it addresses critical aspects that affect RD&amp;I, including IP management, TT management, economics, and project management, all essential for deciphering the complexities of the contemporary technological ecosystem. This holistic approach is reflected in the diversity of the industrial sectors analyzed, ranging from precision equipment manufacturing to software development and consultancy services.

Finally, this manuscript aims to contribute to the academic debate on the future of technological innovation in Brazilian public STIs, proposing future directions for research and practice. By mapping current and emerging trends, this study not only provides

valuable insights for academics, developers, and policymakers in RD&amp;I and TT, but also highlights the critical role of technology in shaping a sustainable and inclusive future. This represents a significant contribution to the understanding of innovation dynamics.

By offering a comprehensive and multidisciplinary analysis, it establishes an important milestone in the study of technologies developed in public STIs in the Brazilian aerospace and defense sector, outlining a promising path for future investigations in this vibrant and rapidly evolving field.

## METHODS

The methodology adopted in this research was meticulously planned to address the complexity and diversity of data related to the innovation and technology development process, ensuring a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of trends and knowledge gaps in the fields studied. A case study methodology was applied in public STIs in the Brazilian aerospace and defense sector.

This work begins with the careful selection of sources, involving an extensive search in patent databases, both from Instituto Nacional de Propriedade Industrial (INPI) and similar bodies abroad.

Data collection presented a significant challenge, given the dispersed and often restricted nature of the necessary information. This multifaceted approach ensured the capture of a broad range of data relevant for analysis.

A patent research and intelligence application, PatSeer, from Gridlogics, was used to support the presented analysis. As disclosed by the company, for the industrial areas related to the technologies, the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) was used. Regarding the categorization of patents into technological domains and subdomains, the International Patent Classification (IPC) was used.

The identification, filtering, storage, and analysis of the data were conducted by the authors aiming to extract valuable insights about emerging trends and potential knowledge gaps.

To substantiate the analysis of the collected data, a systematic review of the established literature was carried out. Systematic review methods were employed to generate trends and descriptive models. This robust theoretical basis allowed for a deep interpretation of the data, contributing to the construction of a detailed situational awareness of the field studied.

The analysis focused on identifying significant trends, rather than presenting purely quantitative results, providing a richer understanding of the emerging patterns in the sector. Data triangulation played a crucial role in validating the findings of this research. Comparing results obtained in the case study strengthened the reliability of the insights generated, ensuring a holistic understanding of the investigated themes.

The research adopted a mixed-methodological approach (Creswell and Creswell 2021), utilizing extensive content analysis of documents and bibliographies, combined with qualitative techniques to demonstrate trends. This mixed approach allowed for a detailed exploration of the variables under study and the identification of significant associations between them.

Considered applied research, this approach aimed to generate practical knowledge to solve specific problems in the field of innovation and TT, using real and consolidated data. The applied nature of the research underscores its objective to contribute directly to innovation and technological development (Creswell and Creswell 2021; Gil 2010; Matias-Pereira 2019; Prodanov and Freitas 2013).

Finally, this research was structured to initially frame itself as an exploratory investigation, aiming to understand complex phenomena from a wide variety of sources. As the research progressed, it adopted a more descriptive character, establishing clear associations between the studied variables and outlining the current landscape of innovation and technologies in the focused STIs. This multifaceted methodology ensured a comprehensive and detailed analysis, contributing significantly to the field of study.

Based on the data presented in the Tables, some information can be inferred, which is important for mapping the technological roadmap and for strategic definition for technological innovation. The data collected, filtered, and analyzed allow a clear analysis of the status of various industries, categorized in different states of activity, namely: ' ALL ' (all cases), ' ACTIVE' (active or ongoing cases), and 'DEAD' (inactive or closed cases) for two distinct categories, 'IAE and IEAv' and 'ITA ' .

Regarding the most represented industries initially, it can be seen that in the categories IAE and IEAv and ITA, the industry of 'Measuring, testing and navigation instruments; watches and clocks' appears as the most represented in terms of total and active cases. This suggests a strong concentration of activity or inventiveness in this specific segment, signaling an area of significant technological competence and potential development in the STIs. This trend not only highlights the existing capabilities in fields of high precision and advanced technology, but also points to strategic opportunities for growth and differentiation in the global scenario. Continuous and focused investments in R&amp;D in this sector could lead to significant advances in measuring and navigation technologies, essential for various applications, from aviation and defense to space and maritime exploration, opening new horizons for the Brazilian industry.

Moreover, policies that encourage the adoption of advanced manufacturing practices and integration into global value chains can reinforce ITA 's position as a hub of innovation and manufacturing.

On the other hand, when we examine the industrial sectors with a high rate of inactive cases (DEAD), we notice that some sectors show a high number of inactive cases, such as 'Basic chemicals, fertilisers, nitrogen compounds, plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms' as seen in the IAE and IEAv category. This could indicate specific sector challenges, such as high competition, regulatory changes, or innovations that make technologies or products obsolete, revealing important nuances about the challenges faced by this sector in the Brazilian context.

This situation may be emblematic of various market and innovation dynamics, including market saturation, increasing regulatory barriers, or the accelerated pace of technological replacement, which can lead to the obsolescence of existing products and technologies. Identifying these patterns is crucial for understanding the barriers to innovation and sustainable growth within specific sectors.

The high incidence of inactive cases in this sector suggests a need for continuous reevaluation and adaptation to market changes and regulatory demands. This could include investments in R&amp;D to create new products and processes that are more environmentally sustainable, efficient, and in compliance with stricter regulations. Additionally, transitioning to bioplastics, organic fertilizers, and other sustainable alternatives could be a key strategy for revitalizing the sector, reducing the rate of inactivity by aligning with growing demands for greener and more responsible practices.

To address these challenges, it is crucial for companies and research institutions involved in these areas to prioritize open innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. This may involve strategic partnerships with other universities, research centers, and tech startups, aiming to accelerate the development of new technologies and their rapid commercialization. International collaboration can also be a way to access new ideas, technologies, and markets, as well as share the risks and costs associated with innovation.

From a public or sectoral policy perspective, encouraging innovation in this sector may involve offering tax incentives, R&amp;D grants, and support for forming innovation clusters that bring together businesses, academia, and government. Such policies can stimulate industrial modernization, sustainability, and international competitiveness. Implementing clear and stable regulatory frameworks is also crucial to providing a predictable business environment that favors long-term investments in innovation.

Finally, the high rate of inactive cases highlights an opportunity for the focused STIs to reposition themselves as leaders in sustainable innovation within this sector. By adopting strategies geared towards a circular economy, resource efficiency, and reducing the environmental footprint, the country cannot only overcome the specific challenges faced by this sector, but also set new standards for sustainability and technological innovation. This direction would not only strengthen the role of public STIs on the global scene as an innovative and responsible nation, but also contribute to sustainable economic development and longterm industrial resilience.
