## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

Purpose: -  This  study  starts  from  the  observation  that  there  is a  mismatch,  in  Brazil,  between  the  strategic  actions  listed  in  the National Defense Strategy, and the capabilities of Strategic Defense Companies.

Design/methodology/approach: - The study is classified from the point of view of the approach to the problem, as qualitative , using the single case study method.

Findings: -  The  use  of  the  DC-Defense  instrument  will  enable Strategic  Defense  Companies  to  know  their  dynamic  capabilities, so  that  they  can,  in  their  strategic  planning,  develop  actions  that allow them to generate competitive advantage.

Research limitations/implications: - As a research limitation, it is pointed  out  the  study  of  a  single  case,  IMBEL,  but  the  data  of Strategic Defense Companies are not available, due to the complexity and sensitivity of the products and technologies involved, which demands secrecy on the part of the high management.

Practical implications: - The DC-Defense instrument aims to help Strategic  Defense  Companies  to  know  their  dynamic  capabilities and set goals in their strategic plans, which allow them to generate competitive advantage.

Originality/value: -  In  this  study,  an  instrument  called  Dynamic Capacities in Defense (DC-Defense) was proposed..

## 1. Introduction

In Brazil, the National Defense Strategy (NDS) presents some challenges to keep up with the growth in demand for Strategic Defense Products (SDP), in order to competitively consolidate  the  Defense  Industrial  Base  (DIB),  such  as:  i)  increase  investments  in Research,  Development  and  Innovation  (RD&amp;I);  ii)  expand  participation  in  domestic and foreign markets; and iii) strengthen the supply chain in the country (Brasil 2020).

Furthermore, it considers important the search for the domain of dual-use technologies,  in  order  to  favor  the  use  of  products  for  military  and  non-military  purposes. Competitiveness is caused by the technological duality, which allows the intersection of civil and military activities, in a virtuous circle (Herteman 2008). The author emphasizes that the duality contributes to reducing the costs of defense materials and to gain export

markets, contributing to the sustainability of technological competences in countries that face budgetary constraints.

The  current  version  of  the  NDS  continues  to  highlight  the  DIB.  However,  the objectives  and  strategic  actions  are  presented  without  much  detail,  highlighting  the need to associate investment in defense with the progress of the related major strategic projects of each armed force (De Rezende and Blackwell 2019).

It  is  then  evident  that  the  Strategic  Defense  Companies  (SDC)  must  know  their capabilities and limitations, which implies the elimination of production activities that do  not  have  demand,  both  internally  and  externally,  and  that  do  not  generate  added value, defining which are the niches of technological competences and areas of excellence that demand investment.

A  company  with  strong  dynamic  capabilities  is  capable  of  implementing  strategic planning  and  implementing  strategic  actions  quickly  and  effectively  (Teece  2014). Dynamic  capabilities,  therefore,  defines  the  company's  ability  to  innovate,  adapt  to changes  and/or  generate  changes  that  are  favorable  to  customers  and  unfavorable  to competitors (Leih, Peteraf, and Teece 2016).

Therefore, we have the following research question: What are the microfoundations of the dynamic capabilities identified in a Strategic Defense Company?

To  answer  this  question,  this  study  is  divided  into  seven  chapters,  including  this introduction. Chapter 2 refers to the conceptual approaches necessary to understand the importance of the topic and is dedicated to presenting the panorama of National Defense, composed of the National Defense Strategy (NDS); concepts and characteristics  of  the  Defense  Industrial  Base  (DIB);  describes  Strategic  Defense  Companies (SDC);  and  briefly  deals  with  the  theory  of  dynamic  capabilities.  In  Chapter  3, a  bibliometric  research  is  carried  out  in  order  to  verify  which  are  the  most  consolidated  authors  and  concepts  on  the  topic  of  dynamic  capabilities.  Chapter  4 addresses  the  methodological  path  adopted  to  achieve  the  proposed  objective. Chapter  5  presents  the  case  study,  Brazilian  War  Material  Industry  (IMBEL). Chapter 6 analyzes and discusses the results, and finally, in chapter 7, the conclusion is  drawn.

## 2. Conceptual approaches

## 2.1 National defense strategy

The National Defense Strategy (NDS), a defense policy document, is formulated from employment hypotheses that are defined considering the threats to the country, establishing  guidelines  for  the  adequate  preparation  and  training  of  the  Armed  Forces, emphasizing the need for the strengthening of strategic sectors in the pursuit of national development (Brasil 2020).

It  highlights, among other guidelines, the need to develop the potential for military and national mobilization to ensure the deterrent and operational capacity of the Armed Forces, that is, theNDS is inseparable from the national development strategy.

In  this  context,  it  is  essential  to  obtain  military  defense  capabilities  through  the development of the country's industrial, scientific-technological  and  logistical  base,  as well as its knowledge. It is, therefore, essential to have an autochthonous defense industry

involved in research, development, production and services to meet the needs of National Defense.

Based  on  the  considerations  contained  in  the  National  Defense  Policy  (NDP),  the document National Defense Strategy (NDS) consists of 18 (eighteen) Defense Strategies (DS), directly aligned to 08 (eight) National Defense Goals (NDG) in which 86 (eightysix) Strategic Defense Actions (SDA) are incorporated. An DS can contribute to more than one NDG, and the same occurs with SDAs in relation to DS. In this case, they may be of identical or different natures (Brasil 2020).

The NDS established guidelines stimulating the interaction of the most varied institutions and companies, aimed at strengthening the DIB, with the main strategic objective of the NDS being the country's scientific and technological training in the military sector (Amarante 2012).

However, the NDS highlights that in order to competitively consolidate the national defense industry, it is necessary to expand participation in domestic and foreign markets and strengthen the supply chain in Brazil.

## 2.2 Defense industrial base

The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) can be seen as a sector or group of industries that have some  dependence  on  public  defense  expenditures,  in  which  the  State  also  has  some degree of dependence for self-sufficiency in the production of defense products means of defense and warfare (Dunne 1995).

The BID is an essential element in the defense of a State. The importance of the BID comes  both  from  its  strategic  nature,  resulting  from  the  production  of  the  country's defense equipment, essential to guarantee the defense and its autonomy, and from its economic aspects, which are related to the mastery of sensitive technologies, many with a dual character, and the generation of innovation, high-skill jobs and exports with high added value.

Despite the reduced percentage of the Defense budget for investments, the BID has generated  a  significant  number  of  direct  and  indirect  jobs  and  some  companies  have managed to maintain a regular flow of exports, even with high and medium technology products, presenting themselves as an alternative to improve the Brazilian trade balance surplus.

Regarding  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP),  BID  develops,  produces  and  markets products and equipment with high added value, playing an important role in national economic growth (Leih, Peteraf, and Teece 2016). The BID represents 4.46% of GDP, generating 2.9 million direct and indirect jobs (Ministry of Defence 2021).

The  structuring  and  strengthening  of  the  BID  constitute  a  strategic  priority  for a  country  like  Brazil,  which,  in  addition  to  having  a  considerable  heritage  of  strategic natural resources that it needs to protect, is seeking an active insertion in the international political and economic scene.

Brazil is a country in which BID has development potential but requires knowledge about  its  current  and  potential  industrial  capacity,  and  of  possible  strategic  partners (Brick, Sanches, and Gomes 2017). Strategic partnerships in the defense sector with other countries  are  important  for  internal  development  and  the  progressive  reduction  of external  technological  dependence,  as  well  as  for  increasing  Brazilian  competitiveness

in terms of Defense Products (Prode). Thus, the perspective of expanding demand for strategic defense products (SDP) offers an excellent opportunity for the development and strengthening of the BID.

In  strategic  sectors  considered  critical,  a  priori,  it  is  up  to  the  State  to  finance  the development of technologies and, eventually, when there are no economic conditions to guarantee the sustainability  of  these  companies,  to  assume  full  responsibility  for  their production (Brick 2011).

In  this  context,  in  2020,  there  was  progress  in  terms  of  financing  for  the  DIB. The  Ministry  of  Defense  and  the  National  Development  Bank  (BNDES)  signed a  protocol  of  intentions  for  structuring  actions  aimed  at  developing  the  defense industrial  base  (Defesanet  2020).  The  initiative  aims  to  promote  technological development  and  Brazilian  exports  in  the  sector.  The  agreement  is  in  line  with the  Strategic  Defense  Action  (SDA-43)  of  NDS-2020,  that  is,  to  improve  the mechanisms  (Brasil  2020).

It stands out that the State continues to attribute its work as a complement to the work of  the  private  sector:  'The  state  component  of  the  Defense  Industrial  Base  should,  in principle, design and produce what the private sector cannot do profitably in the short and medium term. (. . .)' (Brasil 2020, 43). It is also up to the State to use its purchasing power to guarantee conditions for the sustainability and improvement of the DIB.

In NDS-2020 there is a space dedicated to explaining the direction that, ideally, should be adopted in state purchases, which should value the use of products both in the sphere of defense and in the field of public safety (Brasil 2020). The BID, as a strategic asset, the State has to guarantee its preservation, which implies the adoption of protection, development and expansion measures (Moynot 2010). The author argues that

The effect of scientific discoveries, advanced technologies and the development of new fields of  activities  of  activities  makes  it  strategically  necessary  for  the  State  to  have,  directly  or indirectly,  appropriate  financial  instruments  and  a  capacity  to  promote  strategic  investments that open the way for new industries (Moynot 2010, 133).

Even if  one  opts  for  the  supposed  simplicity  of  defining  the  DIB,  based  on  the  set  of companies  that  comprise  it,  these  are  found  in  different  sectoral  classifications,  with varied  production  processes  (technology,  inputs)  and  applications  and  products  for varied  use,  in  the  civil  and  military  market,  which  are  characteristics  of  Strategic Companies of Defense (Sandler and Hartley 2007).

## 2.3 Strategic defense companies

Integrated  into  the  DIB  are  the  Strategic  Defense  Companies  (SDC),  defined  in  Law No. 12598, of 21 March 2012 as well as any legal entity accredited by the Ministry of Defense upon cumulative compliance with the following conditions:

a)  have  as  purpose,  in  its  corporate  goal,  carrying  out  or  conducting  research,  design, development,  industrialization  activities,  provision  of  the  services  referred  to  in  art.  10, production, repair, conservation, overhaul, conversion, modernization or maintenance of PEDs in the country, including the sale and resale only when integrated with the aforementioned industrial activities;

- b)  have  its  headquarters,  administration  and  industrial  establishment  in  the  country, equivalent to an industrial or service provider;
- c)  have,  in  the  country,  proven  scientific  or  technological  knowledge  of  its  own  or  complemented  by  partnership  agreements  with  a  Scientific  and  Technological  Institution  to carry  out  joint  activities  of  scientific  and  technological  research  and  development  of technology, product or process, related toes to meet the activity developed, observing the provisions of item X of the caput;
- d) ensure, in its articles of association or in the acts of its direct or indirect controller, that the set of partners or shareholders and groups of foreign partners or shareholders cannot  exercise  in  each  general  meeting  a  number  of  votes  greater  than  2/3  (two thirds)  of  the  total  votes  that  may  be  exercised  by  the  Brazilian  shareholders  present; and
- e) ensure the continuity of production in the country (Brasil 2012, n.p.).

Data  as  of  29  September  2021,  reveals  that  there  are  120  SDCs  accredited  by  the Ministry of Defense (Mixed Defense Industry Commission [CMID], 2021). 69.2% ( n = 83) are located in the southeast region (57 in the state of São Paulo, 21 in the state of  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  5  in  Minas  Gerais),  22.5%  ( n = 27)  are  located  in  the  south region, 9 in Rio Grande do Sul, 14 in Santa Catarina, 4 in Paraná, and 8.3% ( n = 10) located in the states of the Federal District ( n = 3), Amazonas ( n = 2), Pernambuco ( n = 2),  in  Ceará  ( n = 1),  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul  ( n = 1)  and  Goiás  ( n = 1),  as  shown  in Figure  1.

Evidence  points  out  that  the  SDCs,  before  any  strategic  action,  must  know  their capabilities  and  limitations,  and  prospect  the  future  in  an  integrated  way  in  the  economic, social and political dimensions.

This implies the elimination of production activities that do not have demand, both internally and externally, and that do not generate added value, defining which are the niches of technological competences and areas of excellence that demand investments.

That said, it is observed that the SDC are relevant both in the economic sphere and in social  issues.  However,  they  still  depend  on  political  decisions  that  intend  to  solve existing problems and that support the needs that this sector has.

## 3. Bibliometric research

## 3.1 Dynamic capabilities

The study of dynamic capabilities is an affluent branch of management research activities. The importance of this concept lies in the fact that it deals with the adaptive capacity of the firm in the face of the dynamism of the environment, that is, how organizations can  achieve  and  sustain  competitive  advantages  in  a  changing  environment  (Nelson 1991; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997; Teece 2007).

From  a  theoretical  point  of  view,  the  theme  emerges  and  gains  strength  as  the maintenance of competitive advantage in complex and dynamic environments requires more than just the development of strategic resources and internal competences of the firm, as proposed by seminal authors in the field of Resource Based View (Barney 1986).

In  practical  terms,  the  topic  of  dynamic  capability  gains  relevance,  especially  in increasingly globalized and dynamic markets, where technological change is rapid and systemic (Teece 2007).

In order to verify the existence of publications on dynamic capabilities, in the last ten years, it was decided to carry out a search for articles published on Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), with the expression 'dynamic capabilities.'

In the Web of Science database, the following search filters were performed. In the initial query, the expression 'dynamic capabilities' (all fields) was used, initially locating 94,252  documents.  In  the  first  filter,  'review  articles'  were  selected,  corresponding  to 3,430 documents. In the second filter, the term 'citation topics meso' was used in the 'management' area, with 483 results. Finally, we sought to identify the five most cited articles (Table 1).

The following search filters were used in the Scopus database. In the initial query, the expression  'dynamic  capabilities'  was  used  in  'Title-Abs-Key,'  and  6,362  documents were found. In the first filter, 'open access' documents were selected, corresponding to 1,684  documents.  In  the  second  filter,  documents  belonging  to  the  'Business, Management  and  Accounting'  area  were  selected,  with  1,051  documents  located. Finally, the 'document Type' article was searched, with the return of 954 documents.

Adopting  the  same  criteria  as  the  WoS  database,  the  five  articles  with  the  highest number of citations were analyzed (Table 2).

In the analysis of the articles on Tables 1 and 2 it is pointed out that the article by  Teece  (2007),  which  coined  the  microfoundations  of  dynamic  capabilities,  is cited  in  all  of  them,  which  demonstrates  the  theory  in  a  paradigmatic  way.  In

WoS,  the  article  has  5.252  citations  and  on  Scopus  there  are  6,279  (date  from 20  January  2023),  considered  the  leading  researcher  on  dynamic  capabilities theory.

In the article 'Dynamic capabilities and strategic management,' dynamic capability is defined  as  the  firm's  ability  to  integrate,  build  and  reconfigure  external  and  internal competencies in rapidly changing environments (Teece et al ., 1997, p. 516). Competences are understood as 'the set of organizational routines and processes (specific to the firm), whose performance is provided by the possession of specific assets (difficult or impossible to imitate). Dynamics are understood as situations in which there are rapid changes in technology and market forces that have feedback effects on the firm' (Meirelles and Camargo 2014, 44).

In the work entitled 'Explicating dynamic capabilities: The nature and micro foundations of (sustainable) enterprise performance,' carried out a study identifying the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities explaining that in the analysis it can be disaggregated into  three  organizational  categories: sensing refers  to  the  activity  of  investigating  and identifying market and technology trends and opportunities; seizing - these are organizational structures and procedures for seizing opportunities. From the moment trends (technology and market) are identified, the organization must invest in activities for the development  and  commercialization  of  new  products,  processes  and  services;  and

reconfiguring -new creations and/or reconfigurations of organizational assets, according to technological and market changes (Teece 2007).

It  appears  that  the  organization  must  be  constantly  prepared  to  identify  and  take advantage  of  opportunities,  and  reconfigure  its  assets,  in  order  to  create  an  enabling environment to develop its dynamic capabilities. Thus, strategic thinking must promote reflection on the constantly changing environment in which the organization is inserted, essential to ensure its competitiveness and sustainability.

## 4. Methodology

DCs can be analyzed through in-depth qualitative research (Lee and Teece 2013). Case studies can produce significant insights to contribute to the development of theory in dynamic capabilities (Danneels 2011).

The  present  research  is  classified  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  approach  to  the problem,  as  qualitative,  using  the  single  case  study  method  (Eisenhardt  1989).  From the  point  of  view  of  how  to  approach  the  objectives,  this  research  is  characterized  as descriptive,  since  it  aims  to  analyze  how  the  micro  foundations  of  dynamic  capacity, through the lens of strategy as practice, can contribute to the identification of the origins of capacity dynamics.

The selection of the case was not random, but intentional, as the case is conducive to studying  the  categories  to  be  analyzed,  that  is,  the  selected  company  presents  specific conditions that favor the study of the micro foundations of dynamic capacity, through from the perspective of strategy as practice (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2005).

The  single  case  study,  due  to  its  particularity,  seeks  to  deeply  research  an  object, allowing  to  know  it  in  a  broad  and  detailed  way  (Stake  1995).  The  case  study  is intrinsically analytical, rather than statistical, as it seeks to generalize theoretical propositions (Gates and Schwandt 2018). However, more than the production of generalizations, the method is focused on the particularization of the investigated case (Stake 1995).

In  order  to  validate  the  instrument  developed  in  this  study,  called  Dynamic Capabilities  in  Defense  ( DC-Defense ),  it  was  decided  to  carry  it  out  at  the  Brazilian War  Material  Industry  (IMBEL).  As  for  the  selection  criteria,  the  choice  for  IMBEL considered that it  is  the  oldest  company  in  the  country's  defense  sector,  as  well  as  its know-how  of  senior  management  in  the  market  of  war  products.  There  was  also  an opportunity to align the research with one of IMBEL's strategic objectives, to become, by 2026,  an  independent  public  company,  which  means,  to  have  no  dependence  on resources from the Union (Imbel 2021).

Thus,  the  choice  of  the  IMBEL  case  for  this  study  follows  the  proposed  which  the decision  is  guided  by  the  criterion  of  maximizing  what  can  be  learned  about  the phenomenon from the chosen case (Stake 1995). In addition, the choice is guided by the  receptivity  of  the  case  to  the  research  and  the  researcher's  access  to  the  industry, which constitutes one of the biggest challenges faced by the researchers when the theme is Industrial Defense Base, due to the companies' industrial secrecy, regarding the results on technology  and  production,  trade,  the  labor  market,  research,  development,  and innovation.

In  this  study,  the  method  used,  was  based  on  two  criteria:  in  terms  of  ends  and  in terms of means (Vergara 2004). As for the purposes, the research can be classified as

exploratory,  since  the  proposal  of  a  model  of  dimensions  of  dynamic  capabilities  for Strategic  Defense  Companies,  in  addition  to  being  unprecedented,  lacks  an  initial approach and theoretical-applied deepening.

As for the means, the investigation is of a documentary nature, which allowed, from the  theory  of  dynamic  capabilities,  to  relate  the  microfoundations  with  the  Strategic Defense Actions (SDA) of the National Defense Strategy (Teece 2007; Brasil 2020).

As  for  the  technique  for  data  collection,  a  questionnaire  was  prepared  in  Google Forms, with structured questions, and in the response option, the Likert scale was used, with an interval from 1 to 3, corresponding to: 1- none, 2- partially and 3- fully.

The survey was sent by e-mail, for pre-test purposes, to the manager of a Strategic Defense Company. After the responses were returned, the necessary adjustments were made, such as the insertion of some variables and the exclusion of others.

The questions were answered by the Management and Planning Advisor of IMBEL, returning on 7 November 2020. The respondent informed that for the preparation of the answers, the President, Administrative Director, Industrial Director and Market Director were  consulted.  The  questions  in  the  questionnaire,  composed  by  the  DC-Defense indicators. The questions in the questionnaire, composed by the DC-Defense indicators, according to Table 4 of section 6.

## 4.1 Codification of strategic defense actions and dynamic capabilities

In the document analysis, the National Defense Strategy ([END], Brasil 2020), elaborate by  the  Defense  Ministry,  was  used  to  codify  the  Strategic  Defense  Actions  (SDAs). Defense  Strategies  (DS)  must  be  directly  aligned  with  the  National  Defense  Goals (NDG), established in the National Defense Policy (NDP). SDAs are incorporated into each Defense Strategies (DS), which aim to guide the measures that must be implemented to achieve the NDGs. A DS can contribute to more than one NDG, and the same occurs with  SDAs  in  relation  to  Strategies.  In  this  case,  they  can  be  of  identical  or  different natures.

In  this  study,  the  analysis  was  delimited  in  NDG  III,  which  aims  to - promote technological  and  productive  autonomy  in  the  area  of  defense  (Brasil  2020).  In  NDG III, DSs 8 and 9 deal specifically with the defense industrial environment.

Dynamic capabilities can be perceived as a management mechanism, allowing new organizational, functional and technological combinations, with the objective of understanding, exploring and consolidating the specific competences of the company (Teece et al ., 1997).

DS8 - Promotion  of  the  Sustainability  of  the  Defense  Industrial  Base  Production Chain - aims  to  provide  conditions  of  stability  to  the  activities  of  financing,  research, development, production and sale of Brazilian defense products and to provide sustainability conditions for the production chain, even if subject to special legal, regulatory and tax regimes.

Meanwhile, DS9 - Strengthening the Defense Science and Technology Area - aims at the  development  and  solidity  of  the  ST&amp;I  area  in  defense  matters,  promoting  the absorption, by the production chain, of indispensable knowledge for the gradual reduction of dependence on technology external. In the DS8 and DS9, the SDAs dealing with

the defense industrial environment correspond to the SDA 39, 45, 46, 49, 50, 54 and 57 (Table 3).

The  list  of  SDA  categories  represents  the  general  form  of  the  concept  that  brings together a set of registration units considering their importance and the regularity with which they appear. The registration units served for the codification of the questionnaire applied  in  IMBEL,  in  order  to  verify  which  are  the  dynamic  capacities  identified  in IMBEL, elaborated from the SDA.

It can be seen from Table 3 that the categorization of dynamic capabilities - DCD01 to DCD13 - aims at the elaboration of the DC-Defense instrument, in line with the SDAs of the NDS.

Planning Advisor of IMBEL, returning on 7 November 2020. The respondent informed that for the preparation of the answers, the President, Administrative Director, Industrial Director  and  Market  Director  were  consulted.  The  questions  in  the  questionnaire, composed by the DC-Defense indicators, as well as its answers are described in Table 4.

Of the 13 (thirteen) DC-Defense, 09 (nine) were considered to be partially acquired, and  04  (four)  were  considered  to  be  fully  acquired.  There  were  no  responses  for  any capacity.

However,  such  capabilities  may  have  been  obtained  in  an  emergent  way,  that  is, organizational practice spontaneously promoted the phenomenon of learning, characteristics  observed  in  innovative  organizations  (Mintzberg  1979).  In  the  same  sense, capabilities may have been acquired through routines and the way in which such routines were effectively performed against competitors (Winter &amp; Zollo, 2002).

The DC-Defense considered partially acquired by IMBEL (DCD02, DCD03, DCD04, DCD05, DCD06, DCD07, DCD08, DCD10, DCD12 and DCD13) demonstrate that the company, albeit incipiently, has the capacity to adapt to the dynamism of the defense market environment, making it possible to achieve and sustain competitive advantages, related to the descriptions in Table 3.

The  DC-Defense  fully  acquired  were:  DCD01-  The  company  has  the  capacity  to produce dual-use materials, DCD06- The company has the capacity to supply defense products in the domestic market, DCD09- The company has the capacity to carry out projects involving actors of the triple helix and DCD11- The company has the ability to seek  integration  with  Institutes  of  Science  and  Technology  (ICT).  These  DC-Defense correspond to SDAs 39 (DCD01), 46 (DCD06), 50 (DCD09) and 54 (DCD011) that make up  the  NDG  III,  of  the  NDS  (Brasil  2020),  which  aim  to  promote  technological  and productive autonomy in the area of defense.

We sought to relate the DC-Defense acquired fully by IMBEL with the microfoundations of the dynamic capabilities (Teece 2007) and we find that DCD11 (The company has the capacity to seek integration with Institutes of Science and Technology) corresponds to the seising ;  the  DCD01 (The company has the capacity to produce dual-use materials) and DCD06 (The company has the capacity to supply defense products in the domestic market) corresponds to seizing , and DCD09 (The company has the capacity to carry out projects involving actors of the triple helix model) corresponds to reconfiguring .

The  DC-Defense  fully  acquired  by  IMBEL  are  related  to  the  micro-fundamentals sensing,  seizing  and  reconfiguring.  In  the  field  of  strategic  management,  the  IMBEL structure, mediated by the behavior of its senior management and the Brazilian Army, are determining factors for the improvement of dynamic capabilities, in order to contribute to the development of the Defense Industrial Base ecosystem.

Microfoundation  sensing  involves  actions  that  aim  to  create  hypotheses  about  the future implications of technology and market trends, and to test hypotheses in order to clarify the path for the creation of new products, services and new business models. This is  the  result  of  IMBEL  supplying  defense  products,  in  order  to  meet,  on  demand,  the strategic  projects  of  the  Brazilian  Army,  with  the  use  of  technologies  developed  in  an autochthonous way, by researchers from the Military Institute of Engineering (IME), and through partnerships with Science and Technology Institutes.

The seizing microfoundation denotes the ability of IMBEL to produce materials and weapons for dual use (civilian and military), being a differentiating factor in the market,

given the company's strategy not to depend solely on government purchases, characteristic  of  the  oligopsony market, due to budgetary restrictions caused by periodic crises, characteristic of emerging countries.

As for the reconfiguration microfoundation, it appears that IMBEL seeks to remain competitive, through the combination of its tangible and intangible assets, through open innovation,  based  on  the  search  for  external  knowledge  to  assist  and  accelerate  the internal innovation process (Chesbrough 2012). And there is relationship with the actors of the triple helix model, that is, the interaction with the university and the government (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000).

The  microfoundations  of  sensing,  seizing  and  reconfiguration  are  essential  for  the company to sustain itself in the long term, as customers, competitors and technologies change dynamically and constantly (Teece 2007).

## 7. Conclusions

The article made it possible to answer the research question. When analyzing the DCDefense identified in IMBEL, it appears that most are aligned with the Strategic Defense Actions  present  in  the  National  Defense  Strategy.  The  dynamic  capabilities  related  to NDS, even though they present emergent characteristics, can result from the organizational practice promoted spontaneously, through the phenomenon of learning, observed in innovative organizations.

It  is  noted  that  through  the  DC-Defense constructs,  IMBEL's competitive advantage  is  feasible  and  can  be  achieved  through  the  combination  of  the  use  of  internal resources,  of  its  existing  capabilities,  and  the  acquisition  of  learning  and  technologies  from  external  sources  to  the  production  and  sale  of  products  with  high  added value.

However,  in  the  context  of  dynamic  capabilities  theory,  it  is  accepted  that  not  all competencies are equally important for competitive advantage, so that a given Strategic Defense Company can excel in a relatively restricted number of competencies.

In the same way, the dynamic capabilities stream seeks to provide an explanation of how firms can act to reconfigure, proactively or reactively, their resource base. At this point, the strategic intention of IMBEL to become a public company independent of the Union budget is verified.

It should be noted that in 2021, the Interministerial Ordinance MD/ME No. 4,886 was published, which aims to identify, together with Defense Companies - DC and Strategic Defense Companies - SDC, information that contributes to the conduct of policies aimed at promoting the defense industry, with regard to results on technology and production, trade, labor market, research, development and innovation (Brasil 2021).

The ordinance  published,  in  a  timely  manner,  corroborates  the  assumption  of  this research, that defense policymakers should know the capabilities of defense industries in order to conduct strategies and policies to encourage the DIB, as described above

Art. 1 This Interministerial Ordinance provides for the Annual Report on the Results of the Defense Industrial Base - RARBID, which is dealt with in art. 10 of Decree No. 7,970, of March 28, 2013, with the objective of identifying, together with Defense Companies - DC and Strategic  Defense  Companies  -  SDC,  information that  contributes  to  the  conduct  of policies aimed at promoting the defense industry, regarding the results on technology and

production, trade, labor market, research, development and innovation (Brasil 2021, n.p., our emphasis).

The  DC-Defense  instrument,  which  is  easy  and  simple  to  use,  can  contribute  in a  pragmatic  and  managerial  way  to  Strategic  Defense  Companies,  so  that  they  can learn about their dynamic capabilities and set goals in their strategic plans, which allow them to generate competitive advantage.

As a research limitation, it is pointed out the study of a single case, IMBEL, but the data  of  Strategic  Defense  Companies  are  not  available,  due  to  the  complexity  and sensitivity  of  the  products  and  technologies  involved,  which  demands  secrecy  on  the part of the high management.

As a recommendation for future studies, it is suggested to try to apply the DC-Defense together with other Strategic Defense Companies or even Defense Companies, in order to ratify or rectify the results obtained in this study or even expand to a sample larger, for a quantitative study.
