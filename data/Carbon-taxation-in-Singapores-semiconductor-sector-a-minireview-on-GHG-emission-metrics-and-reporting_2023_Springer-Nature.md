## Abstract

The threat of climate change has catalyzed global endeavors to curb greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon taxation emerging as a pivotal policy instrument. Singapore, akin to Taiwan, has embraced this tool, and its ramifications on their semiconductor industry are both profound and multifaceted. At the outset, the imposition of carbon taxes inevitably escalates production costs for semiconductor firms, compelling them to offset their carbon footprint financially. This escalation, in turn, poses a risk of eroding the industry's competitive edge, nudging firms to contemplate the prospect of migrating to locales with more lenient carbon taxation regimes. However, in juxtaposition to these challenges, carbon taxation unveils a silver lining. It instigates semiconductor entities to recalibrate their operations, infusing energy-efficient technologies and pivoting towards renewable energy avenues. Such transitions not only attenuate their carbon emissions but also curtail their financial burden arising from carbon taxation. This manuscript elucidates a panoramic landscape of both policy innovations and technological strides specific to Singapore's semiconductor arena. It aims to be an instrumental compass for stakeholders, delineating pathways for achieving optimal eco-financial equilibrium in the sector.

## 1  Introduction

The  alarming  rate  of  climate  change  and  its  impending adverse  effects  have  necessitated  global  actions.  Consequently,  carbon  tax  emerges  as  a  pivotal  tool  embraced by  nations,  seeking  to  attenuate  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Its  intent  is  not  solely  to  levy  charges  but  also  to motivate  industries  to  adopt  sustainable  practices  and technologies  (Lee  and  Chang  2018).  Despite  its  ubiquitous  implementation,  the  rationale  for  its  introduction, especially concerning its impact on industries like semiconductor production, needs clear elucidation.

In 2019, Singapore, in alignment with its commitment under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  embarked  on  its  carbon taxation journey. The nation aspires to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions by 36% below the business-as-usual projection by 2030 (Lin and Chiang 2019). Targeting the top  30  greenhouse  gas  emitters,  the  tax  is  predicated on the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of facilities. Notably,  revenues  from  this  tax  are  earmarked  for  climate-centric projects, underpinning Singapore's transition towards a low-carbon paradigm (National Climate Change Secretariat 2019). Conversely, Taiwan, housing the world's foremost semiconductor factories, has proclaimed its carbon tax policy rollout in 2023. This strategy  focuses  on  substantial  emitters  spanning  energy, transportation,  and  industrial  sectors,  with  a  goal  to diminish greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 2005 standards by 2025 (Tan and Tan 2019). The tax's yield is slated for propelling low-carbon innovations and pioneering  green  technologies.  An  intricate  juxtaposition of  these  two  regions'  carbon  taxation  architectures  is presented in Table S1 (Wang and Lin 2020).

Significantly,  the  semiconductor  domain  is  a  cardinal carbon emission source in Singapore and Taiwan, drawing  attention  to  the  potential  ramifications  of  carbon taxation on it. While such a tax may inflate operational expenditures in Singapore, potentially hampering competitiveness,  it  concurrently  paves  the  avenue  for semiconductor entities to spearhead and monetize lowcarbon  technological  marvels  (Wong  and  Tan  2021). Remarkably, both regions' carbon tax frameworks overlook  emissions  emanated  from  land-centric  activities as stipulated by the UNFCCC, alongside transportation emissions and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and Scope 3) linked to electricity consumption. This omission is especially salient given Singapore's reliance on grey electricity,  as  opposed  to  green,  nullifying  carbon  credit  offset possibilities (Tietenberg 2013; Metcalf 2009).

Navigating through this backdrop, this review endeavors  to  furnish  a  meticulous  panorama  of  Singapore's carbon taxation industrial modus  operandi and its repercussions on the semiconductor landscape. Furthermore,  it  delves  into  the  opportunities  and  challenges bequeathed  by  carbon  taxation  to  semiconductor  ventures, accentuating the imperative of a robust GHG emissions  surveillance  and  reporting  mechanism  within  the industry (Li et al. 2020).

## 2    Singapore Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol and carbon taxation

A carbon tax is a policy that puts a price on carbon emissions  by  taxing  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  or  other greenhouse  gases  emitted  by  a  company  or  organization (Tietenberg 2013). The idea behind a carbon tax is to create an economic incentive for companies to reduce their  emissions  by  making  it  more  expensive  to  pollute. The effectiveness of a carbon tax as a policy tool to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change is a matter of debate. Some experts argue that a carbon tax is an efficient  and  effective  way  to  reduce  emissions  because it  creates  a  financial  incentive  for  companies  to  invest in  cleaner  technologies  and  practices  (Metcalf  2009).

By making emissions more expensive, a carbon tax can encourage companies to find ways to reduce their emissions in order to save money. On the other hand, critics of carbon taxes argue that the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income households, and it is difficult  to  implement  and  enforce.  Additionally,  it  may not be sufficient to reduce emissions to the level required to mitigate the effects of climate change (Gautier 2019).

The Singaporean government, acknowledging the need to  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  implemented a carbon tax in 2019, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). Initially  set  at  SGD$5/tCO e  spanning from 2019 to 2023, 2 it's slated  to  escalate  to  SGD$25/tCO e  in  2024  and 2 2025 and SGD$45/tCO2e during 2026-2027, and aims to achieve  SGD$50-80/tCO2e  by  2030.  Facilities  emitting 25,000   tCO e  or  above  annually  are  considered  taxable, 2 while those emitting a minimum of 2,000   tCO e are des2 ignated as reportable. The tax encompasses a spectrum of GHGs, including   CO ,   CH ,   N O, HFCs, PFCs, and   SF . 2 4 2 6 However, GHGs from minor emissions sources unrelated to the main production activity and   NF  are tax-exempt. 3 GHG  emissions  tied  to  transport  fuels  are  subsumed under Customs &amp; Excise duties.

becomes  imperative  for  taxable  facilities.  This  verification,  conducted  by  a  National  Environment  Agency (NEA) accredited entity, scrutinizes the Emissions Report's (ER) accuracy in accordance with the Monitoring Plan (MP). Once verified, the ER must be submitted to NEA by 30th June following each reporting period.

Third-party verification is done to give the verifier confidence to sign off the ER with a reasonable level of assurance. NEA provides templates for Notice of Verification, Verification Plan Summary, and Verification Report that accredited verifiers must use for the conduct of verification and the final verification report (Fig. 2). Companies wishing to provide third-party verification services must be  accredited  by  NEA  through  an  independent  assessment  to  carry  out  the  verification  of  GHG  emissions reporting in line with the Carbon Pricing Act (CPA) and its  accompanying  regulations.  A  site  visit  is  conducted to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  MP  (including  the QMF) (Table S2) is reflective and to check the pressure gauge/weigh  scales  on-site.  Emissions  data/supporting documents  are  to  be  kept  beyond  the  acquisition  date so that the verifier can check the records and for NEA to duplicate the verification if needed (Fig. 3).

In  2023,  Singapore's  commitment  to  curbing  GHG emissions sees a continuation of the Carbon Pricing Act 2018 (CPA 2018). As per Fig. 1(b), third-party verification

The Monitoring Plan (MP) serves as a detailed account of the methodologies and procedures deployed by companies to report GHG emissions accurately, functioning

## NEA's MRV requirements are aligned with international guidelines &amp; practices

## Emissions\_ Report (ERL

- Documents companies' methods, steps &amp; procedures to ensure accurate &amp; complete reporting of GHG emissions
- Serves as a blueprint for third-party verification and ER
- Excel-based reporting template developed in consultation with industries
- Contains actual emissions data, reported annually based on approved MP
- Informs carbon tax liability
- Built on existing GHG reporting requirements under the Energy Conservation Act (ECA)
- Validated by NEA (with the support of experienced consultants for the first round)
- Electronic from in the EDMA system
- Verified to a reasonable level of assurance by third party verifier accredited by NEA

as  a  foundational  document  for  third-party  verification and ER. As an effort to ensure reported GHG emissions' integrity  and  adherence  to  the  ratified  MP ,  an  unbiased assessment  of  the  ER  is  mandated.  As  delineated  in Fig.  3,  these  verification  parameters  echo  the  practices embraced  by  pioneering  carbon  pricing  jurisdictions, such  as  the  EU,  California,  and  Korea.  These  measures also align with international protocols and are enhanced with feedback garnered from  industry consultations with prospective third-party verifiers. The inaugural list of accredited verifiers was made public on NEA's official platform in July 2019 (Ambec et al. 2013).

a  year,  the  facility  owner  must  buy  68,000  credits  from NEA at a cost of SGD $340,000 (68,000 credits x SGD $5 per credit) (Chen 2019). Once the credits are purchased, the  facility  owner  must  surrender  them  to  NEA  by  30 September  of  each  year.  This  process  helps  companies build  up  experience  in  dealing  with  carbon  credits  and lays  the  groundwork for potentially allowing companies to use properly monitored, reported and verified (MRVed)  international  offsets  to  pay  part  of  their  carbon  tax liability in the future.

As indicated in Fig. 4, companies that are subject to the carbon  tax  are  required  to  purchase  fixed-price  credits (FPCs)  from  the  National  Environment  Agency  (NEA) for each tonne of   CO e they emit. The FPCs are priced at 2 SGD $5 per credit, and companies must purchase enough credits  to  cover  their  verified  emissions  for  the  reporting year. For example, if a facility emits 68,000   tCO e in 2

The Singapore carbon tax is a market-based mechanism that encourages companies to reduce their emissions  and  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  while providing  flexibility  in  how  they  comply  with  the  tax. The  FPC  approach  allows  companies  to  manage  their carbon tax liability while also contributing to the government's  efforts  to  mitigate  climate  change.  Singapore's  carbon  tax  is  also  considered  as  a  model  for other  countries  and  regions,  as  it  demonstrates  that

it  is  possible  to  implement a carbon tax quickly, without  causing  significant  economic  disruption,  and  with support from business and the public in the following aspects (Chu 2019):

- 1. Political will: the government of Singapore had a strong desire to address the issue of climate change and was committed to implementing a carbon tax as part of its efforts to reduce emissions.
- 2.  Simplicity:  Singapore's  carbon  tax  is  relatively simple.  It  applies  to  only  large  emitters  and  the rate is fixed at $5 per tonne of   CO . This simplicity 2

makes it easier to implement and less controversial than more complex systems.

- 3.  Economic  considerations:  Singapore  has  a  strong economy and a well-developed infrastructure, which made  it  easier  for  the  government  to  implement  a carbon tax without causing significant disruption to the economy (Tietenberg 2013; Lee 2019).
- 4. Small size: Singapore is a small country which simplifies the administration of the carbon tax, allowing for faster implementation and enforcement.
- 5. International cooperation: Singapore  was  part of  the  Under  2  Coalition,  an  international  agree-

ment among cities, states and countries to limit the increase  in  global  average  temperature  to  below  2 degrees Celsius. This helped them to have a framework for their carbon tax (Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources 2019).

vehicles. This made the implementation of a carbon tax easier as it aligns with the already existing plan.

of emissions, including direct emissions from the manufacturing process and indirect emissions from energy consumption (Fig. 5):

- 1. Raw  material acquisition: the semiconductor manufacturing  process  begins  with  the  acquisition of  raw  materials.  Silicon,  the  primary  material  for most  semiconductors,  is  extracted  from  quartzite gravel or crushed quartz (Chu 2019). The extraction process requires significant energy, typically sourced from  non-renewable  resources,  resulting  in  GHG emissions.  Other  materials,  such  as  gallium  and arsenic  for  compound  semiconductors,  also  have their respective extraction emissions.
- 2.  Silicon  wafer  production:  pure  silicon  is  derived from the raw material and then melted with a small portion of boron in a crucible. This process requires substantial heat, typically sourced from carbonemitting energy sources. The molten mixture is then drawn into a single crystal ingot, which is then sliced into  thin  wafers  (Ministry  of  the  Environment  and Water Resources 2019; Xiao et al. 2023).
- 3. Wafer processing: this is the heart of semiconductor device fabrication, where actual circuits are created on the wafers:
- · Photolithography:  a  light-sensitive  photoresist  is applied to the wafer, exposed to UV light through a  mask,  and  then  developed  to  leave  a  patterned photoresist on the wafer. The solvents and chemicals used in this step have associated emissions.
- · Etching: unprotected parts of the wafer are subjected  to  chemical  or  plasma  etch  processes  to remove material.  This  step  releases  GHG  emissions,  especially  when  using  potent  greenhouse gases  like  sulfur  hexafluoride  (SF6)  in  plasma etching.
- · Ion implantation: ions are implanted in the silicon wafer to modify the properties of the silicon. This requires energy-intensive equipment.
- 4.  Assembly  and  packaging:  after  wafer  processing, the  wafer  is  sliced  into  individual  chips,  which  are then  assembled  into  packages  (Gautier  2019).  This involves the use of lead or gold for connections, and the soldering process can result in GHG emissions. 5. Energy  consumption  and  distribution:  indirect emissions  stem  from  the  electricity  consumed  in manufacturing, cooling, distribution, and other auxiliary processes. Considering the energy-intense nature of semiconductor manufacturing, this is a significant source of GHGs.
- · Oxidation:  silicon  dioxide  is  grown  on  the  wafer surface.  This  step  involves  exposing  the  wafer  to a mixture of high-temperature steam and oxygen, which  can  result  in  emissions  if  not  controlled effectively.
- 6. Waste management and disposal: the semiconductor production process generates waste, from defective chips to spent chemicals and solvents. The treatment,  transportation,  and  disposal  of  these  wastes contribute to the industry's GHG emissions.

Once the emission sources are identified, the next step is to quantify the amount of emissions from each source. This involves collecting data on the energy consumption and production processes, and using emission factors to calculate the amount of GHG emissions associated with each  process  (Tables  S3  and  S4).  The  emission  factors are based on the type of equipment used, the efficiency of the equipment, and the type of fuel or energy source used. These factors are determined by industry standards and best practices, as well as by government regulations and  guidelines.  After  quantifying  the  above  mentioned emissions from each source, the next step is to prioritize the emission streams based on their contribution to the overall  GHG  emissions.  This  helps  to  focus  efforts  on the  most  significant  sources  of  emissions  and  identify opportunities  for  emissions  reduction.  Finally,  once  the emission  streams  are  identified  and  prioritized,  companies  can  develop  and  implement  strategies  to  reduce their emissions. This may include process improvements, equipment upgrades, energy efficiency measures, and the use of renewable energy sources (Li et al. 2021).

The  Singapore  Carbon  Pricing  Act  2018  and  the  ISO 14064-1:2018  standard  both  focus  on  measuring  and reporting  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  However, there  are  some  key  differences  between  the  two  frameworks (Table 2): one major difference is that the Singapore Carbon  Pricing  Act  2018  focuses  specifically  on  direct emissions  (Scope  1)  of    CO ,    CH ,    N O,    SF 2 4 2 6 ,  HFCs,  and PFCs from fuel combustion and industrial processes and product use (IPPU). It includes some exceptions, such as emissions from the combustion of certain biofuels and biomass, as well as diesel with a sulfur content of more than 10 ppm. In contrast, the ISO 14064 Standard includes all three scopes of emissions-direct (Scope 1), energy indirect (Scope 2), and other indirect (Scope 3)-in its guidelines (National Development Council 2019).

## Singapore's Carbon Pricing Act 2018 (NEA Carbon Tax)

## ISO 14064-1:2018 (International Standard)

| Reckonable emissions ($$)   | All direct emissions of  CO2 , CH , N O, SF , HFCs and  4 2 6 PFCs , from: • Fuel combustion • Industrial processes and product use (IPPU), exclud- ing emissions defined as non-reckonable Note: Reckonable emissions also include: •  CH 4  and N O emissions from combustion of biofuels  2 or biomass •  CO 2 ,  CH 4  and N O emissions from combustion of diesel  2 with sulphur content of more than 10 ppm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Scope 1         | Direct GHG Direct GHG generated from the facilities  within the boundary of the organization                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-reckonable emissions    | •   NF 3  emitted in any circumstance •   SF 6  emitted in the course of manufacturing, install- ing, using or disposing of any electrical equipment •   CO 2  emissions used and emitted in the course  of purging, ➣  blasting, ➣  using any lubricant or paraffin wax, ➣  combustion of any of the following: ➣  biodiesels ➣  bio gasoline ➣  charcoal ➣  landfill gas ➣  sludge gas ➣  sulphite lyes (black liquor) ➣  wood or wood waste ➣  other biogas ➣  other liquid biofuel ➣  other primary solid biomass • HFCs and PFCs emitted in the course of using  any refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment  for non-manufacturing purposes • Any GHG emitted in the course of ➣  using any fire protection equipment, ➣  using any fuel on which excise duty is payable,  or which is exempt from the payment of excise duty,  under the Customs Act (Cap. 70), and ➣  emitted as a fugitive emission (excluding flaring  and venting) | Scope 2 Scope 3 | Energy indirect GHG Indirect GHG of the input of electricity, heat and steam  within the boundary of the organization Other indirect GHG Other indirect GHG applicable in the upstream  and downstream outside the boundary of the organi- zation |

Another  difference  is  the  inclusion  of  non-reckonable emissions in the ISO 14064 Standard. These are emissions that are not included in the calculation of GHG emissions, such as   NF  emitted in any circumstance or   CO  emissions 3 2 from the combustion of certain types of fuels. The Singapore Carbon Pricing Act 2018, on the other hand, does not have  a  separate  category  for  non-reckonable  emissions. It is important to note that the Carbon Pricing Act in Singapore excludes certain types of emissions. Firstly, indirect emissions  from  the  consumption  of  electricity,  referred to as Scope 2 emissions, are not included in the Act. This is because  Singapore's  electricity  grid  still  relies  heavily on fossil fuels, resulting in a high carbon footprint for electricity  consumption.  Secondly,  emissions  from  landbased activities, as defined by the United Nations Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  are also excluded from the Carbon Pricing Act (International Energy Agency 2018). Finally, transport emissions are not covered by the Act, which means that the industry is not directly  incentivized  to  reduce  emissions  from  transportation.  It  is  important  to  consider  these  exclusions  when evaluating the effectiveness of the Carbon Pricing Act in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Singapore.

Additionally,  the  ISO  14064  Standard  provides  more detailed guidelines for GHG emissions measurement and reporting,  including  requirements  for  quality  management, transparency, and accuracy. The Singapore Carbon Pricing Act 2018, while providing guidelines for reporting and verification, does not have the same level of detail as the ISO 14064 Standard.

## 4    Implementation principles of GHG emission measurement

While carbon dioxide   (CO ), methane   (CH ), and nitro2 4 gen  oxides  are  undeniably  primary  contributors  to  the greenhouse effect,  it  is  essential  to  understand  that  the semiconductor  industry  has  a  unique  emission  profile. In  this  industry,  fluorine-based  gases,  also  known  as F-gases, are especially prominent due to their widespread use in manufacturing processes. F-gases, although emitted in smaller quantities compared to   CO  or   CH , have 2 4 a significantly higher Global Warming Potential (GWP). This  means  that  even  in  small  amounts,  these  gases can  have  a  pronounced  impact  on  global  warming.  For instance,  some  F-gases  can  have  a  GWP  thousands  of times higher than   CO , making their controlled emission 2 crucial  for  industries  that  rely  heavily  on  them,  like  the semiconductor industry.

Moreover, the semiconductor industry's reliance on intricate manufacturing processes involving etching and chamber  cleaning  often  requires  F-gases  like  perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride   (SF ),  and  hydrofluorocarbons 6 (HFCs).  Their  specific  applications,  unfortunately,  do  not have  straightforward  replacements  that  perform  equally well without having a high GWP with the consideration of following aspects (Tietenberg 2013; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 2019):

- 1.  Specific  impact  analysis   detailed  analysis  should : focus  on  how  carbon  pricing  policies  impact  the emissions of F-gases in the semiconductor industry. Understanding  the  types,  quantities,  and  specific GWPs of each F-gas will offer a comprehensive view of the industry's carbon footprint.
- 2. Supporting calculations for reduction measures : when  examining  potential reduction measures, it is crucial to consider alternatives to F-gases with low GWPs, energy-efficient equipment, and waste reduction  strategies.  Calculations  should  account for  baseline  emissions,  projected  emission  reductions post-implementation, and an economic analysis  detailing  the  costs  and  benefits  of  the  measures.
- 3.  Basis  of  preparation  and  monitoring  plan:  the standard  operating  procedure  (SOP)  documentation, the Basis of Preparation (BOP), and the Monitoring Plan (MP) are grounded in the "2019 IPCC Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories,  Volume  3,  Chapter  6"  (IPCC  GL)  and  the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) GWP values. These guidelines serve as a robust foundation to estimate emissions,  providing  the  semiconductor  industry with  a  reliable  framework  to  monitor  and  report their F-gas emissions.

## 4.1    Global Warming Potentials (GWPs)

The  application  of  GWPs  is  pivotal  for  comparing the  impacts  of  diverse  greenhouse  gases  on  climate change. In essence, GWPs provide a metric that converts the effect of various gases into a unified measure known as   CO2 equivalent   (CO e). This becomes espe2 cially  crucial  in  the  semiconductor  industry,  which frequently  employs  gases  like    CF   and    C F , 4 2 6 both substantial  contributors  to  GHG  emissions.  Through GWPs,  we  can  equate  the  influences  of  these  different  gases  into    CO 2 e,  streamlining  comparisons.  For example, while   CF  boasts a GWP of 6,630,   C F  is sig4 2 6 nificantly more impactful with a GWP of 11,100 over a 100-year span. This suggests that despite potentially larger  absolute  emissions  from    CF ,    C F   has  a  far 4 2 6 greater effect on climate change (refer to Table S5).

Moreover,  the  table  provided  compares  the  GWPs  for different gases used in semiconductor  manufacturing between two standards: the Singapore Carbon Pricing Act

(CPA)  2018  and  the  IPCC  (Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change) 2019. GWPs are a measure of how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere over a given period,  compared  to  the  same  amount  of    CO   equiva2 lent   (CO e). It can be seen from the table that the GWPs 2 for most gases are the same in both standards, except for C3F8,   C F ,    C 4 8 5 F8 ,  and    NF 3 .  The  GWP for   C F  is 8900 in 3 8 CPA 2018 and 11,000 in IPCC2019, while the GWPs for C4F8 and   C F  are higher in CPA 2018 than in IPCC2019. 5 8 NF3 has a higher GWP in IPCC2019 than in CPA 2018. Some of the gases have by-products that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. For example, CF4 has by-products such as   C F ,   C F , and   CHF , which are also potent 2 6 5 8 3 greenhouse gases (International Energy Agency 2018).

Furthermore,  the  IPCC2019  standard  differentiates  the use of   CF  in different applications (e.g., Thin Film &amp; Etch). 4 The use of GWPs in the calculations is essential to compare the impact of different greenhouse gases on climate change, and  the  comparison  between  different  standards  helps  to understand the impact of greenhouse gas emissions in different regions and industries.

## 4.2    Calculation approach

The calculation approach for the Singapore's GHG emission is used to estimate emissions and its by-product by using the formula mentioned in the 2019 IPCC Guidelines  for  National  Greenhouse  Gas  Inventories  (Chapter 6 - Electronics industry emission, Tier 2c of Volume 3:  Industrial  processess  and  product  use).  The  formula (Eq.  1)  for  estimation  of  FC  emissions  is  indicated  as below (Carbon Tax Center 2023; World Bank 2018).

Where the Parameter ID and corresponded reporting status have been summarized in  Table 3.

The    FC g,  used refers  to  the  quantity  of  fluorinated compound  fed  into  process;  Ag  is  defined  as  the fraction  of  fluorinated  compound  (g)  volume  used with  emission  control  technology.  It  is  determined by  the  design  of  the  abatement  system,  which  takes the considerations of its running mode, maintenance settings,  and  the  connection  methodology  with  the production machine (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 2019; Carbon Tax Center (2023). An example of the calculation approach with dummy  data  is  also  provided  in  the  supplementary materials sector.

The fraction of the fluorinated compound (Dg) that is  neutralized  by  the  emission  control  technology  is termed as the destruction rate (DRE) of the abatement system, as referenced from the IPCC 2019, Chapter 6, Table 6.6 (Carbon Tax Center 2023; World Bank 2018). With  the  continuous  advancement  and  refinement  of abatement  technologies,  the  Fourier-transform  infrared (FTIR) testing method, which measures concentrations before and after passing through a local scrubber, is deemed  acceptable  according  to  the  IPCC  2019 guidelines.  In  the  foreseeable  future,  semiconductor companies might amplify their adoption of abatement systems. For such implementations, detailed specifications or testing methodologies, such as the FTIR test, can be procured from local scrubber vendors and subsequently  validated  by  an  accredited  third-party  testing institution.

## 5    Risk and opportunity of greenhouse gases reduction in semiconductor industry

## 5.1    Impact of carbon taxation on the semiconductor industry

Singapore is a major player in the global semiconductor industry, and the implementation of a carbon tax could have  significant  impacts  on  this  industry,  both  positive and negative. One potential effect of a carbon tax is an increase in production costs for semiconductor companies, which could result in higher prices for semiconductors, making them less competitive in the global market. However, a carbon tax could also encourage companies to  adopt  more  energy-efficient  technologies  and  practices to reduce emissions and lower costs in the long run. Moreover, a carbon tax could encourage innovation and investment in research and development to find ways to reduce  emissions,  resulting  in  the  development  of  new technologies  and  practices  to  lower  emissions  in  the industry. Additionally, companies could invest in carbon offset projects to neutralize the carbon emissions generated by the semiconductor industry.

However,  there  is  also  the  potential  for  "carbon  leakage,"  where  the  implementation  of  a  carbon  tax  could discourage  companies  from  investing  in  Singapore  and Taiwan  due  to  the  increased  costs  of  production.  This could have negative economic impacts, especially if the tax is not implemented in a fair and equitable manner for companies (Carbon Tax Center 2023).

The  details  of  the  carbon  tax,  such  as  the  rate  and coverage,  as  well  as  the  circumstances  of  each  country  or  region,  will  determine  its  effects.  Therefore,  it should be implemented as part of a comprehensive and coordinated policy package with other measures, such as energy efficiency standards, renewable energy mandates, and  research  and  development  funding,  to  mitigate  the negative effects while promoting the reduction of emissions (World Bank 2018).

## 5.2    Novel strategies of GHG reduction in semiconductor industry

The best emission reduction procedure is selected for the specific  situation.  The  strategies  will  take  into  account relevant  plant  environmental  factors  and  engineering techniques, such as executable capability, efficiency, and other considerations.

Process  optimization Process  optimization  is  a  crucial  approach  to  minimize  greenhouse  gas  consumption,  particularly  fluorinated  greenhouse  gas  emissions. To  achieve  this,  various  process  variables  are  altered, including chamber pressure, temperature, plasma power, cleaning gas flow rate, gas flow time, and the gas mixture ratio. By adjusting these variables, significant reductions in carbon emissions can be realized (International Semiconductor  Industry  Association  2019).  Chemical  vapor deposition (CVD) chamber cleaning and etching are two procedures that greatly benefit from such optimizations.

An important tool in process optimization is the endpoint inspection system. This system employs techniques like  mass  spectrometry  (MS),  IR  spectroscopy,  optical emission spectroscopy (OES), and radio frequency (RF) impedance monitoring. The data provided by these techniques  facilitates  real-time  feedback,  helping  industries fine-tune  their  processes.  Notably,  endpoint  inspection is particularly prevalent in cleaning CVD chambers, but its  utility  also  extends  to  etching  and  other  operations involving fluorinated greenhouse gases (Zhu et al. 2023).

For a real-world illustration, Samsung Electronics  serves  as  an  exemplary  model.  By  tailoring  process variables  such  as  chamber  pressure  and  temperature, Samsung  achieved  a  commendable  reduction  in  carbon  emissions  during  their  semiconductor  production processes (International Semiconductor Industry Association  2019).  After  implementing  these  optimization strategies,  the  results  were  conspicuous:  Samsung  witnessed a 15% decrease in carbon emissions during chip manufacturing compared to preceding cycles. This strategic  move  translated  to  a  substantial  environmental saving, equivalent to approximately 30,000   tCO e on an 2 annual scale (Li et al. 2005).

Greenhouse  gas  substitution To  combat  the  challenge of  escalating  net  fluorine-gas  emissions,  several  strategies  can  be  deployed.  One  of  the  foremost  solutions  is to transition from high GWP gases to those with a lower GWP or even no GWP. Moreover, there is an emphasis on optimizing the efficiency with which these gases are used in plasma processes. Although there are alternative chemical methods that employ high GWP gases, if utilized more efficiently in plasma processes, they can still result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (Li et al. 2004). Safety, of course, remains paramount. When adopting alternative chemicals, it is imperative to evaluate  the  implications  on  operational  safety  within  fabs, the  protection  of  employees,  and  the  broader  environmental impacts (Metcalf 2009).

A prime example of this proactive approach is the Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  (TSMC), the  world's  leading  dedicated  independent  semiconductor  foundry.  TSMC undertook the challenge of phasing out perfluorocompounds (PFCs), which are notorious for their high global warming potential. Instead, they opted for  environmentally-friendlier  alternatives  (Liang  et  al.

2023).  This  commendable switch, fortified by the introduction  of  state-of-the-art  abatement  equipment,  culminated in a significant decline in their GHG emissions. Yet, this evolution was not devoid of hurdles. TSMC had the dual task of ensuring that while GHG emissions were curtailed,  neither  product  quality  nor  employee  safety was jeopardized. The outcome of their commitment was a  substantial  25%  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  for  certain  manufacturing  processes,  equivalent  to  a  decrease of 50,000   tCO e within a single fiscal year. Furthermore, 2 their environmental stewardship is evident in their ambitious  goal  to  slash  GHG  emissions  by  an  added  10%  in the ensuing three years (Li et al. 2004).

Advanced  abatement  methodology The  semiconductor industry, on a global scale, has made substantial strides in developing and commercializing advanced  abatement technologies. Historically, the industry has leaned towards  localized  abatement  systems  over  centralized emission  reduction  strategies,  particularly  for  fluorinegases.  This  preference  stems  from  the  fact  that  tackling emissions at the source often proves more efficient, preventing the gases from getting further diluted and contaminated. The innovative methodology that is currently in  vogue  connects  each  emission  stream  directly  to  a dedicated  local  scrubber.  Such  an  approach  facilitates precise  and  accurate  measurements  of  F-gas  emissions, ensuring  a  streamlined  capture  and  treatment  process (Gautier  2019;  Ambec  et  al.  2013).  The  systematic  flow and  characteristics  of  GHG  within  the  Industrial  Processes and Product Use (IPPU) domain are meticulously mapped out.

It  is  crucial  to  understand  that  the  efficiency  of  these venting  systems  is  significantly  influenced  by  various factors.  This  includes  the  specific  venting  equipment  in use, and process conditions like temperature, fluorinated greenhouse  gas  inlet  concentration,  flow  rate,  pump purge  rate,  and  overall  inlet  flow  composition  (Li  et  al. 2003). Illustrating the application of these methodologies, companies  like  GlobalFoundries  stand  out.  They  have adopted the  localized  abatement  strategy,  wherein  each emission stream is directly tied to a local scrubber. This allows for an enhanced measurement of F-gas emissions, ensuring that the majority of harmful gases are addressed at  the  source  (Gautier  2019;  Ambec  et  al.  2013).  Their results are noteworthy: by embracing this more granular approach  complete  with  integrated  scrubbers,  GlobalFoundries experienced a 20% surge in abatement system efficiency.  Translating  this  into  tangible  environmental benefits, they managed to reduce emissions by approximately 40,000   tCO e every year. Further testament to the 2 efficacy of their system is that it reportedly captured and neutralized  nearly  95%  of  detrimental  F-gases,  substantially curbing their atmospheric release.

Remote  plasma  cleaning  system The  remote  plasma cleaning system emerged as an innovative solution to the traditional  in-situ  CVD  chamber  cleaning.  Its  primary function is to efficiently cleanse the residues left behind in the chamber after the deposition process (Wong and Tan  2021).  In  this  method,  the  plasma  generation  unit is  strategically  located  at  the  CVD  chamber's  entrance. The cleaning procedure is typically initiated by inducing a reaction in the   NF  plasma. Subsequently, the fluorine 3 radicals  and  ions  produced  in  the  remote  plasma  unit are  channeled  into  the  processing  chamber.  Here,  they undergo a chemical reaction with the deposited materials (Li et al. 2004). The resulting by-products, which include compounds like   SiF , are then expelled in a gaseous form. 4

Given its efficiency and advantages, this remote plasma cleaning  technology  has  become  a  standard  for  CVD chamber cleaning (Wong and Tan 2021). Notably, equipment suppliers have begun manufacturing or even adapting  existing  remote  plasma  systems.  This  allows  for  the retrofitting of certain processing tools, effectively replacing  the  initial  chemistry  used  for  fluorine  gas  cleaning  (International  Semiconductor  Industry  Association 2019). As technological advancements continue to shape the  industry,  new  methodologies  related  to  F-gases  will be periodically assessed and disseminated (National Development  Council  2019).  To  ensure  that  the  industry remains updated, the "Best Practices" document will also  undergo regular revisions. However, for companies wishing to gauge their emissions or the efficiency of novel technologies, adherence to a stringent measurement protocol is imperative (International Energy Agency 2018).

One of the trailblazers in this domain is Applied Materials, globally recognized for delivering manufacturing  solutions  tailored  for  the  semiconductor  realm.  The company's  proactive  shift  from  the  conventional  insitu  cleaning,  which  involved  introducing  cleaning  gas directly inside the chamber, to the remote plasma cleaning  technology  is  commendable.  By  generating  plasma externally  and  then  routing  it  to  the  processing  chamber, the risk of undesirable reactions, which might jeopardize semiconductor device quality, is minimized. This novel approach not only cuts down on cleaning durations but also extends the operational lifespan of the chamber components and significantly curtails GHG emissions (Li et al. 2004). In real-world results, Applied Materials' transition to the remote plasma cleaning system bore fruitful outcomes. They documented a 10% slash in GHG emissions  during  their  chamber  cleaning  operations.  Additionally, due to reduced chamber wear and tear, there was

a  noteworthy 20% extension in its service life. Translating this into quantifiable environmental gains, the annual GHG  emissions  were  curbed  by  a  staggering  15,000 CO2 t e (International Energy Agency 2018; Li et al. 2003).

## 5.3    Economic and technological pathways to low-carbon semiconductors by 2050

The  transition  to  low-carbon  semiconductor  technologies over the next two to three decades predicates a multifaceted  approach,  marrying  technological  innovations with astute investment strategies and adherence to evolving regulatory frameworks. In the realm of technological advancements,  a  pivotal  role  is  played  by  material  and manufacturing  process  innovations,  aiming  at  reducing the  carbon  footprint  and  enhancing  energy  efficiency, respectively. For instance, research endeavors may probe into  alternative  materials  and  energy-efficient  methodologies, potentially exploring silicon carbide (SiC) or gallium nitride (GaN) which are renowned for their superior electronic properties and have been spotlighted for their potential in reducing energy losses during operation (Sun et al. 2023).

Investment  and  funding  dynamics  are  equally  critical in  propelling  the  transition  towards  sustainable  semiconductor technologies. Here, a dual focus on bolstering R&amp;D investments  and  leveraging  government  subsidies will  be  paramount  to  drive  innovation  while  ensuring economic viability. The potential economic ramifications of  this  transition,  analyzed  through  meticulous  costbenefit analysis and ROI evaluations, will be intrinsic to gauging  the  financial  feasibility  and  long-term  sustainability of adopting  low-carbon  technologies.  Furthermore, it is imperative to scrutinize the impact on the job market, recognizing the skills and workforce adaptations necessitated by the technological transition.

A pivotal factor that is likely to shape the trajectory of the semiconductor industry is the regulatory framework, particularly pertaining to carbon emissions and sustainability.  The  imposition  of  carbon  taxes  and  stringent regulations, potentially modeled on existing frameworks such  as  the  European  Union  Emission  Trading  System (EU ETS), could act as a catalyst, propelling companies towards  expedited  adoption  of  low-carbon  technologies to mitigate financial repercussions. Conversely, this regulatory  landscape  might  also  pose  challenges  and risks,  particularly  pertaining  to  technology  maturation and  supply  chain  adaptations.  The  time  frame  for  new technologies  to  mature  and  become  commercially  viable,  along  with  ensuring  a  robust  supply  chain  capable of supporting low-carbon technologies, warrants careful consideration.

In  navigating  through  these  challenges,  the  industry might derive insights from past case studies, examining instances  of  both  successes  and  failures  in  transitioning  to  low-carbon  technologies  across  varied  sectors. This  historical  lens  could  afford  valuable  lessons,  guiding  strategies  to  circumvent  potential  pitfalls  and  emulate  successful  paradigms.  Moreover,  the  global  impact of  the  transition,  notably  in  carbon  footprint  reduction and  alignment  with  global  sustainability  goals  such  as the Paris Agreement, necessitates a thorough analysis to ensure that the shift not only aligns with global directives but also contributes substantively towards mitigating the impacts of climate change.

## 6    Conclusion

Singapore  has  actively  embraced  carbon  tax  policies as a strategy  to  diminish  greenhouse  gas  emissions, subsequently  addressing  the  pressing  concerns  of  climate  change.  The  implications  of  these  policies  are pronounced  for  the  semiconductor  industry,  a  notable contributor to carbon emissions. Introducing carbon tax undeniably escalates operational costs for semiconductor corporations, yet it simultaneously opens avenues for the inception  and  commercialization  of  eco-friendly,  lowcarbon  technologies.  These  major  policy  implications may include:

- 1. Innovation stimulus: carbon tax policies can act as a catalyst, driving semiconductor companies towards pioneering advancements in green technologies.
- 2.  Competitive  edge:  companies  adapting  rapidly  to these policy changes may gain a competitive advantage,  especially  in  markets  where  environmentallyconscious decisions are valued.
- 3. Economic shifts: the broader economic landscape could  evolve,  with  potential  shifts  in  job  markets favoring green tech roles, research, and development in the semiconductor domain.
- 4. Regulatory  compliance:  with  stringent  policies, semiconductor  companies  must  ensure  regulatory compliance  to  avoid  penalties,  further  emphasizing the need for constant monitoring and adaptation.

While the onset of carbon tax policies poses challenges, it undeniably fosters a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices. Semiconductor corporations must remain vigilant, tracking these policies to optimally harness opportunities for sustainable and low-carbon innovations.
