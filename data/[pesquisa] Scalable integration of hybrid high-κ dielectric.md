Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising channel materials for next-generation field-effect transistors (FETs). However, it remains challenging to integrate ultrathin and uniform high -κ dielectrics on 2D semiconductors to fabricate FETs with large gate capacitance. We report a versatile two-step approach to integrating high-quality dielectric film with sub-1 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) on 2D semiconductors. Inorganic molecular crystal Sb O  is homogeneously deposited on 2D semiconductors 2 3 as a buffer layer, which forms a high-quality oxide-to-semiconductor interface and offers a highly hydrophilic surface, enabling the integration of highκ dielectrics via atomic layer deposition. Using this approach, we can fabricate monolayer molybdenum disulfide-based FETs with the thinnest EOT (0.67 nm). The transistors exhibit an on/off ratio of over 10  using an 6 ultra-low operating voltage of 0.4 V, achieving unprecedently high gating efficiency. Our results may pave the way for the application of 2D materials in low-power ultrascaling electronics.

The  continuous  downscaling  of  silicon-based  metal-oxidesemiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistors (FETs), which facilitates the development of the modern semiconductor industry, is approaching its fundamental limit . Further transistor scaling requires reduc1 ing the body thickness of the channel semiconductor to mitigate short-channel effects (SCEs) 1-3 . In this context, van der Waals (vdW) two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS2 , WSe , etc.) and black phosphorus, exhibit exceptional 2 advantages over silicon 4-6 . They can be ultimately thinned down to atomic thickness thanks to their layered structure, theoretically allowing unprecedentedly excellent gate control in a MOSFET architecture, and, moreover, their charge carrier mobilities can be highly preserved at atomic thinness for their dangling bond-free surface. For instance, prototypical FETs based on the 2D semiconductor MoS  with sub-1 nm 2 gate lengths have demonstrated excellent current switching 4,5 .

However, the vdW surface of 2D semiconductors also gives rise to another critical challenge: the integration of high-quality dielectrics. In theory, the characteristic length, λ , of FETs without SCEs is determined by: 2,7

dioxide, respectively; and EOT is the equivalent oxide thickness, as defined. Clearly, besides the quest for channel thinness ( t s ), it is of great significance to integrate ultrathin high -κ dielectrics (small EOT) on 2D materials for ultimate transistor scaling . Moreover, a 8 smaller EOT implies a larger gate capacitance, which can effectively reduce the supply voltage ( V dd ) and the energy consumption of the device. According to the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS) 9 , state-of-the-art MOSFETs (5 nm node FinFET) require a sub-1 nm EOT and a V dd lower than 0.8 V. Nevertheless, owing to the inert dangling bond-free surface of 2D materials, it has proved difficult to integrate ultrathin dielectrics, particularly in a scalable way 7 . In addition, the integration process of dielectrics needs to be non-destructive, and, ideally, they should form a vdW interface with 2D semiconductors to preserve the intrinsic properties of the 2D semiconductors and minimize the density of interfacial states 10,11 . Although various attempts, such as direct deposition 12-15 , oxidation of deposited metal 16-23 , surface pretreatment 24-31 and organic materials as a seeding layer 7,32-34 , have been made to address this critical challenge, a universal approach for the integration of a high-quality dielectric layer with sub-1 nm EOT on 2D materials is yet to be explored. Due to the absence of high-quality dielectrics, despite their expected better gate electrostatics than for conventional semiconductors, 2D FETs still require a higher operating voltage than state-of-the-art Si MOSFETs.

Here, we report a versatile approach to integrate an ultrathin high -κ dielectric layer with sub-1 nm EOT on 2D materials. We deposit the inorganic molecular crystal antimony trioxide (Sb O ) as a special 2 3 buffer layer on 2D semiconductors. The buffer layer contacts with 2D

semiconductors via vdW interactions, which create a high-quality oxide-to-semiconductor interface with low interfacial state density. Moreover, the buffer layer covers up the hydrophobic 2D materials (such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides) and offers a highly hydrophilic surface, allowing the integration of ultrathin high -κ dielectrics (HfO , Al O  and ZrO ) via standard atomic layer deposition 2 2 3 2 (ALD). In this way, we can fabricate a hybrid inorganic dielectric layer with an EOT of 0.67 nm on 2D semiconductors, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the thinnest EOT integrated on 2D semiconductors. FETs made of a monolayer MoS  channel and Sb O /HfO  hybrid 2 2 3 2 dielectrics can switch over on an on/off ratio of 10  using an ultra-low 6 operating voltage of 0.4 V, with a subthreshold swing (SS) approaching the thermionic limit of 60 mV dec -1 . This exceptional gating efficiency, which cannot be matched by any FETs reported so far, is attributed to the high-quality dielectric layer and the excellent electrostatic controllability of the 2D semiconductors.

## Integration processes of hybrid dielectrics

The integration processes of the hybrid dielectric layer start with the fabrication of Sb O  on 2D semiconductors via a thermal evaporation 2 3 deposition method (Fig. 1a). We choose the thinnest layer Sb O  of 2 3 1 nm that can fully cover the surface of the 2D materials as the buffer layer. Afterwards, typical high -κ dielectrics, for instance, HfO , can be 2 integrated onto Sb O  via a standard process of ALD to form a hybrid 2 3 dielectric layer on the 2D semiconductor (see details in Methods). As revealed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 1b), both the deposited Sb O3 2 layer and the HfO  layer remain dense and 2 homogeneous, without observable voids. The integration of Sb2 O3

and HfO2 layers slightly roughens the atomically flat MoS  surface, as 2 shown in the height histograms (Fig. 1c). In contrast, direct deposition of HfO2 on 2D materials results in a rough and porous layer, with some HfO2 particles nucleated, probably at the defect sites (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). We also demonstrate that this excellent buffering effect of Sb2O3 promoting the ALD of HfO  can clearly be observed on few-layer 2 graphene (Supplementary Fig. 1c). As probed by Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b), the underlying 2D materials remain intact during the dielectric integration. Moreover, this approach is applicable for the integration of various dielectrics (Al O  and ZrO ), since they 2 3 2 share the same ALD mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), demonstrating the versatility of using Sb O  as a buffer layer. 2 3

To analyse the quality of the dielectric layer at atomic scale, we observe the cross-sectional interface of the stacking layers via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The two layers of Sb2O3 and HfO2 stacking on MoS2 can be clearly identified (Fig. 1d), exhibiting atomical homogeneity over the whole surface of MoS2, which agrees well with our observations by AFM (Fig. 1b). The top layer of MoS2 clearly remains intact, without observable damage induced by the dielectric integration process (Fig. 1d). Moreover, a gap between Sb2O3 and MoS2 is also visible (about 3.3 Å), indicating the vdW contact between them. The stacking structure of HfO2/Sb2O3/MoS2 is also confirmed by the elemental maps (Hf, Sb and Mo) at the interface (Fig. 1e). The electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) of Sb O  indicates 2 3 preservation of the molecular structure over the whole integration process (Fig. 1f) 35 , which means that the deposited Sb O  layer forms 2 3 a vdW contact with MoS2 . Such a vdW interface between the 2D semiconductor and the oxide has proved critical for device performance 36 .

As the buffer layer merely ignites the ALD process of high -κ dielectrics, the interface remains the same for the integration of a thicker layer of HfO2 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

We now try to gain insight into the formation mechanisms of the Sb2 O3 and HfO2 layers on top of the 2D material. With respect to this two-step process, we first carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the deposition behaviours of Sb O 2 3 molecules on 2D MoS2, and then used first-principles calculations to figure out the precursor adsorption mechanisms in ALD (see Methods for details). Sb O  molecules may experience various behaviours 2 3 (deposition, surface diffusion, reflection, nucleation, etc.) in the MD simulations

(Fig. 2a). From the simulations (Supplementary Video 1), Sb O 2 3 molecules can spontaneously form a homogeneous and dense layer on 2D materials when enough molecules are deposited (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, we find that the interlayer distance (3.32 Å) between the stabilized Sb O  layer and MoS  approximates to the vdW gaps 2 3 2 within MoS2 (3.33 Å), which confirms the formation of a vdW interface between Sb2O3 and MoS2 (Fig. 2b). Such a homogeneous Sb2 O3 layer contacting 2D MoS2 via vdW interaction can be maintained at a stable state for a long period of simulation time (Fig. 2c). We then turn to the adsorption of the precursors, which play a decisive role in the ALD process (Supplementary Fig. 5). We first optimized the adsorption of precursor H2 O molecules onto the MoS2 surface and figured out five possible adsorption configurations, with an H O/MoS2 distance of 2 around 3 Å (Fig. 2d). Contrarily, the optimized adsorption configurations of H O on Sb O  exhibit much smaller interatomic distances, of 2 2 3 below 2 Å, approaching the typical length of hydrogen bonds in water

(Fig.  2e  and  Supplementary Fig. 6a) 37 .  We  then  calculated  the adsorption energies of all such configurations, which are presented together with the interatomic distances in Fig. 2f. The larger adsorption energies and smaller distances of H O on the Sb2O3 surface 2 imply that the Sb O  molecules dramatically improve the adsorp2 3 tion probability of precursors in the ALD process. Such a contrast of Sb O3 2 promoting H2O adsorption can also be found on graphene (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The adsorption tendency of H O molecules 2 at molecular scale can be verified by the wetting behaviour of water droplets at macroscale. We demonstrate experimentally that a thin Sb2O3 layer can greatly increase the hydrophilicity of graphene, with a reduction of the contact angle from 90  to 54  (Supplementary o o Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, we were able to probe the formation of HfO  on 2 the surface of Sb O  using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 2 3 on the sample with only one H O-TDMAHf (tetrakis(dimethylamido) 2 hafnium) ALD cycle (Supplementary Fig. 7c), which further confirmed efficient precursor adsorption on the Sb O  layer. 2 3

## 2D FETs gated by hybrid dielectrics

We now demonstrate the application of our hybrid dielectric layer in high-performance 2D electronic devices. We integrate the hybrid Sb O / 2 3 HfO2 dielectric layer on 2D semiconductors to fabricate 2D FETs and investigate their device performance. In the FETs (Fig. 3a), 2D MoS 2 was chosen as the representative channel semiconductor, Bi/Au was used as the electrode to minimize contact resistance 38 and the Sb O / 2 3 HfO2 layer was integrated on top of the MoS  as the gate dielectric (see 2 Methods for details). We first examined the FETs based on monolayer MoS2 prepared by mechanical exfoliation, usually with high crystal quality, as evidenced by the dependence of channel conductivity on carrier density 39 (Supplementary Fig. 8). For systematic study, we designed two different thicknesses of our hybrid dielectric layer ( t d = 3 nm and 5 nm), respectively, with HfO  of 2 nm and 4 nm on the buffer layer of 1 nm 2 Sb2O3. For such FETs with a t d of 3 nm and 5 nm (corresponding to ultrasmall EOTs of 0.67 nm and 1.01 nm, respectively), the drain-to-source currents I ds abruptly switch over 10  within an ultra-low top-gate voltage 6

of 0.4 V (Fig. 3b). The FET with an EOT of 0.67 nm exhibits a full on/off ratio of over 10  using a low operating voltage of 0.6 V (Fig. 3b). Such 7 a high gating efficiency can obviously be attributed to an ultra-low SS in the transfer characteristics. We can identify a range of I ds switching over four orders of magnitude (Supplementary Figs. 9c and 10c), with the SS remaining at the Boltzmann thermionic limit of approximately 60 mV dec -1 (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the output curves verified that the top gate effectively controls the conductance of the channel MoS  (Sup2 plementary Figs. 9d and 10d). A dozen such FETs have been fabricated to verify the reliability of our dielectric integration approach. All the FETs demonstrate SS values between 60 and 75 mV dec -1 . Despite such slight deviations of the SS from 60 mV dec -1 , which probably result from the interface states introduced in the device fabrication process, this performance still adheres to the requirements of future FETs proposed in the IRDS . On the basis of the minimum SS of 60 mV dec 9 -1 that we achieved in our FETs, we are able to estimate the typical density of interface states ( D it ) between our hybrid dielectric layer and the MoS 2 channel as 1.4 × 10 11 and 2.2 × 10 11 cm -2 eV -1 for t d of 5 and 3 nm, respectively (Methods). Such a small D it can be attributed to the formation of a vdW interface during the integration of our hybrid dielectric.

We tried to extract the exact EOTs of our hybrid dielectric layers in devices by measuring the electrical transport of dual-gating FETs

(Supplementary Figs. 9a,b and 10a,b). The EOTs for the hybrid dielectric layer with a t d of 3 nm and 5 nm were 0.67 and 1.01 nm, respectively, both of which are in good agreement with theoretical values of 0.65 nm and 0.96 nm (see 'Dielectric property parameters calculation' in the Methods). Moreover, using a capacitor device, we directly measured the capacitance of the dielectric layer with t d = 5 nm under various bias voltages and at various frequencies (Supplementary Fig. 11). Thanks to the all-inorganic dielectric materials of our hybrid dielectrics, the capacitance remained stable between 3.2 and 3.5 μF cm -2 over a broad range of frequencies, agreeing with the calculated static capacitance of 3.45 μF cm -2 .

Clearly, our dielectric integration approach on 2D semiconductors is compatible with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing processes. To demonstrate the reproducibility of our devices and their application potential in future integrated circuits, we used large-scale monolayer MoS2 obtained by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) as the channel semiconductor to fabricate FET arrays and common logic gates (Supplementary Fig. 12). We fabricated 16 FETs in an array with t d of 5 nm (Fig. 3d) and found that 14 of them work normally, with a yield of 87.5%. All these FETs require operating voltages of about 0.8 V (Fig. 3e), while exhibiting on/off ratios and SS values that are comparable with the state-of-the-art Si FETs (Fig. 3f).

The average threshold voltage ( V th ), on/off ratio and SS values in FET arrays are 0.24 V, 5 × 10  and 73 mV dec 7 -1 , respectively. Both the statistics for V th and SS exhibit narrow Gaussian distributions (Supplementary Fig. 13), indicating a satisfactory uniformity for our FETs. Our approach also allows the integration of logic gates with low supply voltage V dd (Fig. 3g). For example, using 1 nm EOT dielectrics, the NAND, NOR and NOT gates can operate with V dd of 0.5 or 1 V (Fig. 3h,i). Our approach is scalable and exhibits high reproducibility, leading to a considerably high device yield. We have confirmed the application potential of our dielectric layer in 2D integrated circuits.

## Shorter channel FETs and the benchmark of hybrid dielectrics

The FETs using our hybrid dielectrics exhibit superior performance regarding some important figures of merit, including SS, on/off ratio and operating voltages. Nevertheless, the on-state current is still limited due to the wide channels and a local top gate that can only partly control the channel semiconductors. We demonstrate that the on-state current can be significantly improved in FETs with the global back gate and a shorter channel (Fig. 4a-c). For the FET with a global back gate and smaller channel length L ch (80 nm), the SS remains below 70 mV dec -1 (Fig. 4b) and the on-state current density goes beyond 100 μA μm -1 (Fig. 4b). An on/off ratio of over 10  can be realized using a low gate 8 voltage of 0.65 V (Fig. 4b). The global back gate efficiently controls the whole channel, giving rise to a much larger on-state current of over 250 μA μm -1 (Fig. 4c). We expect that if narrower channel FETs can be fabricated, the on-state current density of our FETs would be further improved to a magnitude of mA μm -1 .

We benchmarked the device performance of our FETs with state-of-the-art 2D FETs and silicon MOSFETs (Fig. 4d,e). We achieved integration of the dielectric layer with the thinnest EOT (0.67 nm) on 2D semiconductors via a high-quality semiconductor-to-oxide interface, resulting in excellent gate control over the channel conductance, with an SS of 60 mV dec -1 (Fig. 4d). In addition, as the atomically thin 2D semiconductors intrinsically have a reduced electrostatic screening effect, 2D FETs with the thinnest gate dielectric EOT demonstrate unprecedentedly efficient gating controllability in FETs reported so far, that is, achieving a large on/off ratio with a small operating voltage (Fig. 4e). It is worth noting that our hybrid dielectric layer consists of all-inorganic oxides, with a breakdown electric field of 17.6 MV cm -1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a). The leakage current remains below 10 -7 A cm -2 (dynamic random access memory limit) under an electric field of 2.4 MV cm -1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Such dielectric properties also outperform the reported dielectric layers integrated on 2D materials, which may allow further applications in other devices beyond FETs (Supplementary Fig. 14b-d). Moreover, we also show excellent environmental stability for our FET over seven months, exhibiting the robustness of the dielectric layer (Supplementary Fig. 15). In general, given the excellent properties of our hybrid dielectric layer and the demonstrated device performance of the integrated 2D FETs (Supplementary Table 1), we expect to see its application in ultrascaling low-power 2D devices in the future.

## Methods

## Thermal evaporation deposition of Sb2O3

The deposition of Sb O  was carried out in a standard thermal evapo2 3 ration deposition system (Nexdep, Angstrom Engineering) in a high vacuum (10 -6 torr) 15 . Sb O  powder was sublimated by heating and 2 3 deposited on the surface of the substrate. The deposition rate was precisely controlled by an in situ quartz crystal oscillator. To maintain the flatness of the obtained Sb O  film, the deposition rate in this work 2 3 was 0.03 Å s -1 for the entire fabrication process.

## ALD of high -κ dielectric materials

The ALD process was carried out in a hot-wall, closed-chamber desk-top ALD reactor (GEMStar XT, Arradiance). All the deposition processes were executed at a base pressure of ~50 mTorr and used 40 sccm Ar as the carrier gas. ALD of HfO  proceeded at 140 °C using TDMAHf and 2 H2O as precursors. The TDMAHf precursor container was heated to 75 °C. The pulse/purge times for TDMAHf and H2 O precursors were 1,000 ms/20 s and 60 ms/20 s, respectively. The ALD of ZrO  was car2 ried out at 150 °C, and tetrakis(dimethylamino)zirconium (TDMAZr) and H2O were the precursors. The TDMAZr precursor container was heated to 60 °C. The pulse/purge times for TDMAZr and H2O were 60 ms/30 s and 60 ms/30 s, respectively. For Al O  deposition, the 2 3 deposition temperature was 140 °C and the precursors were trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O. The pulse/purge times for TMA and H2O were 100 ms/30 s and 60 ms/30 s, respectively.

## 2D material preparation

2D MoS2 flakes and few-layer graphene were mechanically exfoliated onto the 300 nm SiO2/Si substrate using the standard Scotch tape technique. Large-scale monolayer MoS2 film was grown on a sapphire substrate using the CVD method and then transferred onto the SiO2 /substrate 44 .

## Morphological and structural characterization

The morphological characterization and surface flatness measurements of the samples were carried out on atomic force microscope (Bruker Dimension FastScan) with a peak-force tapping mode. Raman spectroscopy was performed on a confocal Raman system (WITec Alpha300) with an incident laser of 532 nm at 5 mW. The cross-sectional samples of HfO2/Sb2O3/MoS2 stacking layers were fabricated with a standard lift-out process using an FEI Helios G5 UX dual-beam focused ion beam system. STEM characterization and EDS analyses were carried out on a Jeol ARM300F2 GRAND ARM2 atomic resolution analytical microscope with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Bright-field imaging mode was chosen for the sample observation, and elemental mapping was used to distinguish the different stack layers, including Hf, Sb and Mo. A Gatan dual-EELS system was used for STEM-EELS data acquisition to further confirm the presence of the Sb O  layer. 2 3

## MD simulations of Sb2 O3 molecules

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator and the visualization was realized by OVITO and VMD v.1.9.3 (refs. 45-47). The Sb O  molecule was described 2 3 by the universal force field (UFF) model and its atomic charges were obtained by Bader charge analysis 48,49 .  The  substrate MoS  was 2 described by the empirical VA8 model force field, which is considered to be a promising model in the prediction of the structural properties of MoS2 (refs. 50,51). The non-bonded interactions were described by the van der Waals interactions and the electrostatic interactions, with a cutoff of 1.25 nm. The former were modelled by the 12-6 Lennard-Jones potential, with parameters of the UFF. The latter was modelled by Coulomb's law with a PPPM method computing long-range Coulombic interactions 52 . The timestep in the simulation was set to 1 fs. Before the deposition simulation of Sb O  film, the substrate MoS  consisting of 2 3 2 5,376 Mo atoms and 10,752 S atoms, with a size of 15.187 nm × 15.344 nm, was fully relaxed in the NPT ensemble at 300 K. The corresponding simulation box size during deposition was 15.187 nm × 15.344 nm × 15.3 nm, with periodic boundary in the x y , direction and fixed boundary in the z direction. The Sb O  film deposition process was simulated by 2 3 injecting Sb O  molecules at 14 nm in the   direction per 8,000 fs. The 4 6 z initial kinetic energy of the injected Sb O  molecules was 0.2 eV in a 4 6 direction perpendicular to the substrate. The bottom layer of substrate MoS2 was fixed to maintain bulk conditions and the upper layer was free to interact with injected Sb O  molecules. The system was simulated 4 6 in the NVT ensemble and the temperature was controlled at 300 K in the Langevin thermostat 53 . After the deposition process, another 4 ns was simulated to make the system reach equilibrium. The interlayer distance (LD) was calculated as LD = COM  - COM  - 0.5 1 2 d 1 - 0.5 d 2 , where COM1 is the centroid of mass of the upper layer, COM  is the centroid 2 of mass of the lower layer, d 1 is the thickness of the upper layer and d 2 is the thickness of the lower layer.

## First-principles calculations of H O adsorption 2

The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the VASP package and the post-processing of data was conducted using VASPKIT 54,55 . The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional in the generalized gradient approximation was implemented to describe the exchange-correlation interaction, and the projector-augmented wave pseudopotential planewave method was used to describe the core-electron interaction 56,57 . The planewave cutoff energy was set to 520 eV in both lattice relaxation and static calculation. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a gamma-centred Monkhorst-Pack k -mesh with reciprocal lattice spacing ≤0.2 Å -1 (ref. 58). The convergence criterion was 10 -8 eV for energy and 10 -2 eV Å -1 for force. The DFT-D3 method was utilized to better describe the interactions 59 .  The adsorption energy of a single molecule of H2O was calculated as E = ( E tot -E sub - × n E w ) n , where E tot is the total energy of the system, E sub is the energy of the substrate model, E w is the energy of the H O molecule in 2 the gas phase and n is the number of adsorbed molecules of H O. 2

## Contact angle measurements and XPS analysis

The water contact angle measurements were performed on a Powereach JC2000D1. The XPS measurements were carried out on an AXIS Supra + instrument. All the XPS spectra presented in this work were calibrated with the C 1  peak at 284.8 eV. s

## Transfer of monolayer MoS2

The monolayer MoS2 films grown by CVD were transferred from the sapphire growth substrate onto the SiO /Si substrate for device fabri2 cation using a wet transfer process. First, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was spin-coated (2,000 r.p.m.) onto the MoS  film and baked 2 on the hotplate at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, the PMMA/MoS2 stacks were released from the sapphire by etching in 0.5 mol l -1 sodium hydroxide aqueous solution at 60 °C. The freestanding PMMA/MoS2 film was transferred onto the SiO /Si substrate then rinsed in deion2 ized water several times. To dry the samples and enhance the adhesion, the SiO /Si substrate with PMMA/MoS2 film was baked on the 2 hotplate at 60 °C for 30 min. Finally, the sample was immersed in acetone at 60 °C for 12 h to remove the PMMA.

## Top-gate transistor fabrication

Similar fabrication procedures were adopted for all the top-gate transistors. First, source and drain electrodes were patterned by standard electron-beam lithography (EBL), followed by deposition of metal on the electrodes. After lift-off of metal in acetone, the device was further rinsed in clean acetone for 12 h at 60 °C to minimize the residues of PMMA on the surface of the 2D materials. The cleanness of the 2D materials plays an important role in the subsequent deposition of Sb2O3 and the ALD process. Then, Sb O  and HfO  were deposited onto 2 3 2 the channel area using the aforementioned methods. Finally, the gate

electrode was aligned patterned between the source and drain and similarly fabricated. For all the FETs based on exfoliated and CVD of MoS , 2 10 nm Bi/90 nm Au was used as the source, drain and gate electrodes.

## Logic gate fabrication

The fabrication of logic gates was largely the same as for the fabrication of the top-gate transistor. To obtain the logic devices array, MoS 2 film was first etched into several separate parts using EBL-patterned PMMA as the mask with reactive ion etching. Then, the Bi/Au bottom electrode, HfO2 /Sb2 O3 dielectric layer and Bi/Au top electrode were prepared as described above.

## Electrical measurements

Electrical measurements were carried out with a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyser. We pumped the chamber and kept it in a high vacuum (10 -6 torr) for 1 h to eliminate gas adsorption on the device surface before the device test. Capacitance-voltage and capacitance-frequency measurements were performed with a Keysight B1500A semiconductor characterization system.

## Dielectric property parameters calculation

The dielectric property parameters mainly include capacitance ( C ), dielectric constant ( ε ) and EOT. Theoretically, the capacitance of the stack ( C tg ) comprises contributions from both Sb O  and HfO : 2 3 2

where t SbŢOţ ( HfO Ţ ) and εSbŢOţ ( HfO Ţ ) are the thickness and dielectric constant of Sb O  and HfO  respectively, and 2 3 2 ε 0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum. The values of εSbŢOţ and εHfOŢ used were 11.5 and 25, respectively 11,15 .

In  addition, C tg can  also  be  extracted  by  double-gate measurement: 60

where C bg and V bg are the capacitance and applied voltage of the back gate, respectively, and V th (tg) is the threshold voltage of the top gate. The capacitance of the SiO  substrate (300 nm) was estimated to be 2 1.15 × 10 -2 μF cm -2 . The EOT was calculated as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 3.45 μF cm -2 is the gate capacitance of 1 nm SiO . 2

## Estimation of the density of interface states

Density of interface states ( D it ) was employed to evaluate the interface quality using the following equation: 19,61

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the top gate, q represents the electron charge, SS is the subthreshold slope, k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the test temperature.

## Energy-delay-product calculation

The energy-delay-product (EDP) is a factor to indicate the switching energy of FETs 62 . The EDP can be calculated as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where C tg is the capacitance of the top gate, V dd is the supply voltage, and is equal to the bias voltage V ds .
