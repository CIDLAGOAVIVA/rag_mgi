Keywords: Tauc plot Bandgap Semiconductor Extrapolation

The Tauc method is the conventional technique for estimating the accurate optical bandgap energy of semiconductors using UV -Vis spectroscopy. The proper bandgap is usually determined by directly extrapolating the linear region of the optical spectrum to the horizontal axis of the Tauc plot ( α hv ) 1 / r vs. hv . However, the use of unconventional Tauc plots, such as α 1 / r vs. hv , A 1 / r vs. hv , and F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv are also found in the literature. This raises a debate as to whether these nontraditional methods can produce the correct bandgap value. These uncommon methods appear frequently even in recent papers published in reputable journals, and therefore, have raised concern to investigate the likelihood of obtaining the correct bandgap value using the unusual methods. Results showed that the plots of α 1 / r vs. hv , and A 1/r vs. hv yielded bandgap values that were consistent with those deduced from the universal Tauc plot, whereas the other methods failed.

## 1. Introduction

Optical bandgap is a crucial parameter in determining the precise field of application of semiconducting materials. Therefore, the proper bandgap value must be determined to ensure optimum device application and performance. Elliot (in 1957) proposed a classical relationship from the band theory of semiconductors for direct, indirect, and directforbidden transitions (Elliott, 1957). About six years after (in 1966), Tauc together with co-workers Grigorovici and Vancu introduced the basis of the semiempirical method for optical characterization of nonsingle-crystal materials. Because of this reason Eq. (1) has been widely referred to as Tauc law (Landi, 2021). This can be considered somewhat unfair for Elliot who was the first to propose the concept.

The factor r depends on the nature of the electronic transition and is numerically equal to 1/2, 3/2, 2 or 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed,  or  indirect  forbidden  transitions,  respectively  (Landi  et  al., 2022; Jubu et al., 2023; Jubu et al., 2022; Jubu et al., 2022).

On the other hand, the equivalent α can be calculated from diffuse reflectance  spectral  using  Eq.  (5)  proposed  by  Kubelka  and  Munk (Kubelka and Munk, 1931; Jubu et al., 2020).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Eq. (8) implies that the α is photon energy dependent. Thus, multiplying the lefthand side by hv takes us back to Eq. (1). However, some authors ignore  the  term hv that  appeared  in  the  denominator  of  the  Eq.  (8) because  it  has  an  almost  the  same  order  of  magnitude  or  order  of magnitude  even  minor  of  the E q term,  where E = hv. This  leads  to bandgap determination from the graph of α 1 / r vs .  hv (Anwand et al., 2011; Erken and Gümüs ¸, 2018; Lang et al., 1999; Hong et al., 2005) when working with transmission and absorption UV -Vis spectroscopy data.

where F ( R ∞ ) is the Kubelka-Munk function which is equivalent to α , R ∞ = Rsample / Rstandard is the reflectance (R) of an infinitely thick specimen, while K and S are the Kubelka-Munk absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively. For diffuse reflectance, Eq. (1) transforms into Eq. (6) (Jubu et al., 2023);

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The optical bandgap can be obtained from Eq. (1) by setting the Tauc function ( ( α hv ) 1 / r ) on the lefthand side to zero and dividing both side of the equation by the constant A to give the bandgap hv = Eg . Therefore, when working with absorbance and transmittance data, the Tauc plot ( α hv ) 1 / r vs. hv would lead to an extrapolation to give the bandgap at the point of interception of the straight line with the horizontal axis ( hv -axis) when the Tauc function is equal to zero. This suggests that the vertical axis must be started from the origin. For diffuse reflectance, the graph of [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs .  hv would  lead  to  an  extrapolation  to  produce  the bandgap on the horizontal axis.

## 1.1. Brief theoretical backing for the inclusion of the term hv = E in the righthand side of eqs. (1) and (2)

The theoretical explanation of the so-called Tauc equation is wellestablished  in  the  literature  (Landi  et  al.,  2022;  Tauc  et  al.,  1966; Tauc, 1970; Coulter and Birnie, 2017; Harynski et al., 2022; Yang et al., ´ 2004). Eqs. (1) and (2) implies that the incident photon energy hv must be included in the righthand side of the equations. In a brief approach, it has  been  stated  that  the α and  scattering  ( )  coefficients  of  a  semis conductor (or insulator) are the function of the incident photon energy ( hv ). The α and s are the intrinsic optical properties of a material and represent  the  probabilities  of  light  being  absorbed  and  scattered, respectively, per unit path length (Landi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2004). It has been proposed that the absorption occurs essentially in the material, while the scattering is due to the inhomogeneity of the material and, to the first approximation, may be considered as independent of the absorption (Landi et al., 2022). If the characteristic dimension, d , of the inhomogeneities is significantly smaller than the wavelength λ , that is d ≪ λ , the s can be given by Eq. (7a) (Booker and Gordon, 1950);

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Eq. 7 is known as the Rayleigh scattering. On the other hand, a weak dependence will occur if the λ ≪ d ,  as stated in Eq. (7b). The general form of Eqs. (7a) &amp; (7b) is s ∝ E q , where q = 4 or 2 (Landi et al., 2022).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The nature of the spectrum of the absorption coefficients is dependent on the type of the material under investigation. The principal absorption mechanism  for  semiconductors  is  due  to  interband  transitions,  suggesting that the absorption coefficient can be written as in Eq. (8) (Basu, 1997).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In the case of UV -Vis diffuse reflectance measurement, equivalent α is given by the Kubel-Munk function, as stated in Eq. (5). The parameters K and S, which appeared in Eq. (5) are dependent on the intrinsic absorption α and scattering s coefficients of the material, as given in Eq. (9) (Landi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2004).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

According to Eq. (10), it may not be correct to interpret the KubelkaMunk function (Eq. (5) as the absorption coefficient (Talukdar et al., 2020).

The measurement of diffuse reflectance implies that the ratio between  the  Kubelka-Munk K and S coefficients  has  been  obtained. Therefore, the combination of Eqs. (5), 7a, 7b, 8 and 9 makes it possible to write Eq. (10) (Landi et al., 2022).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It is possible to approximate the relatively slow varying factor E q in the vicinity of the bandgap Eg , in comparison to the α , by a constant. In other words,  the  scattering  phenomenon  is  considered  as  being  neglected, such that the s and S are being taken as constants. This takes us back to Eq.  (6),  which  allows  for  bandgap  determination  from  the  graph  of [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs . hv. However, some researchers ignore the term hv that appeared in the left-hand side of Eq. (6), thereby providing erroneous bandgap estimates ((Kucio et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2021) that deviate largely from those derived from the conventional Tauc plot [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs . hv . This is quite misleading and deeply rooted in misconception.

## 1.2. Bandgap determination from the unconventional Tauc plots

It can be inferred that the Tauc method is well-established (Landi et al., 2022; Tauc et al., 1966; Tauc, 1970; Coulter and Birnie, 2017; Harynski  et  al.,  2022;  Yang  et  al.,  2004),  and  its  successful  imple-´ mentation  for  accurate  bandgap  determination  is  dependent  on  the expertise of the researcher (Escobedo-Morales et al., 2019). Some uncommon/ unconventional UV Vis optical plots for bandgap determi--nation  appear  frequently  in  several  published  papers.  Some  authors atypically estimate bandgap energy from the graph of α vs. hv (Kundu et al., 2021); α 1 / r vs. hv (Anwand et al., 2011; Erken and Gümüs ¸, 2018; Lang et al., 1999; Hong et al., 2005); A vs. hv (Hong et al., 2005); A 1/r vs. hv (Hile  et  al.,  2019;  Hone  and  Dejene,  2018;  Echendu  et  al.,  2018; Zanatta, 2019; Emegha et al., 2021); F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv (Kucio et al., 2021; Meng et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2021) and F ( R ∞ ) 1 / r vs. hv ; instead of the comprehensive Tauc plots ( α hv ) 1 / r vs. hv or [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs . hv , which contains  all  the  elements  as  presented  in  Eqs.  (1),  (2).  The  unusual bandgap estimation techniques can be referred to as unconventional/ nonstandard/uncomprehensive Tauc plots if the term hv and the power factor are omitted from the Tauc functions ( α hv ) 1 / r and [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r . The  practice  of  estimating  the  bandgap  of  semiconductors  from  the various unusual methods stirs doubt as to whether these methods can produce the correct bandgap value. Although a few of these atypical methods can produce the precise bandgap value, some of the techniques may fail. Therefore, it would be reasonable to experimentally exploit all

the methods to identify those that are reliable when compared with the results derived from the ideal Tauc plot.

Many attempts have been dedicated to exploring the UV -Vis optical plot types that can produce proper bandgap values of semiconductors. Recently, Landi et al. (Landi et al., 2022) cautioned that it was inappropriate to determine bandgap from the plot of F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv . The group used the UV -Vis data of pressed TiO2  nanoparticles with varying layer thickness to demonstrate that the incomprehensive Tauc plot (F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv ) derived from UV -Vis diffuse reflectance have the tendency to produce an overestimation of the bandgap. However, Landi and co-workers didn t comment on the prevalent use of the graph of ' α 1 / r vs. hv , A vs. hv , A 1 / r vs. hv , and F ( R ∞ ) 1 / r vs. hv by some researchers to determine optical bandgap energy (Ehika and Ikhioya, 2017; Anwand et al., 2011; Erken and Gümüs ¸, 2018; Lang et al., 1999; Hong et al., 2005; Echendu et al., 2018; Zanatta, 2019; Emegha et al., 2021; Maku a et al., 2018; Zhong ł et al., 2023; Chahrour and Yam, 2019). The other publications on the conscientization of the material scientists about the Tauc method are not closely  related  to  the  present  report.  For  instance,  Escobedo-Morales et al. (Escobedo-Morales et al., 2019) proposed an automated method of processing samples that contains more than one optical absorption edge  in  the  optical  spectral  before  proceeding  to  extrapolate  the bandgap value. The automated method was based on a five-step algorithm, namely preprocessing, segmentation, merging, identification of the Tauc baseline segment pairs, and finally estimation of the bandgap. A correct application of the automated method could help to identify the correct segments in the spectrum to fit the extrapolated Tauc line and the baseline. Maku a et al. (Hu et al., 2020) proposed that the proper ł bandgap of a sample consisting of the mixture of an organic material and a  semiconductor  could  be  determined  by  withdrawing  the  semiconductor spectrum from the spectral sum before constructing the Tauc plot. The  case is simple when  dealing  with  diffuse reflectance measurement because, it is  often  difficult  to  split  the  Kubelka-Munk spectrum into individual components. Therefore, the first step should involve a linear fit of the fundamental peak, and finally the application of  a  linear  fit  as  an  abscissa  in  the  slope  below  the  fundamental  absorption to intersect the fitted Tauc line of the fundamental bandgap. The bandgap is then derived from the point of intersection of the two lines.

Recently, Zhong et al. (Li et al., 2021) proposed that the absorption spectrum  obtained  from  UV -Vis  measurement  must  be  idealized  by removing or subtracting the baseline to obtain the accurate bandgap, otherwise the estimated value would be erroneously determined by the techniques of plugging a baseline in the sub-band absorption to intersect the extrapolated Tauc line (Jubu et al., 2022; Jubu et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2022; Naveena et al., 2019; Brik et al., 2022), and by directly extending the extrapolated Tauc line to the hv -axis (Suram et al., 2016;  Viezbicke  et  al.,  2015).  Brik  et  al.  (Dolgonos  et  al.,  2016) cautioned  that  the  frequently  encountered  statement,  such  as ' the bandgap was calculated from the Tauc plot ' is incorrect. This is because the word 'calculation ' implies the use of an equation and/ or a computational method; whereas 'determination ' of the bandgap from the Tauc plot can at best be described as an 'estimation , but not 'calculation ' ' as it is often referred. Also, other related works by several researchers are found  in  the  literature  (Landi,  2021;  Jubu  et  al.,  2020;  Coulter  and Birnie,  2017;  Zanatta,  2019;  Jubu  et  al.,  2022;  Jubu  et  al.,  2022; Schwarting et al., 2017; Baek et al., 2018; Jing et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023). All these publications do not comment on the unusual plots of α 1 / r vs. hv A ; 1/r vs. hv , and F ( R ∞ ) 1 / r vs. hv deployed by some researchers to estimate bandgap energy.

The general acceptance of the unusual methods is difficult because of the  scarcity  of  a  publication  to  provide  experimental  evidence  that demonstrate  that  these  simple  techniques  can  provide  reasonable

bandgap values that are consisting with those deduced from the standard Tauc plot. Therefore, the present work deploys experimental results to demonstrate the tendency of some of the uncommon UV -Vis optical plots to produce reasonable bandgap values that are essentially the same with those obtained from the comprehensive Tauc plots of ( α hv ) 1 / r vs. hv for transmission and absorption, and [ F ( R ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs. hv for diffuse reflection measurements. The UV -Vis spectroscopy data of direct  bandgap  ZnO  and β -Ga2O3  semiconductors  were  used  for  this study. The authors hope that the readers will identify the techniques that are promising to yield dependable bandgap values. Also, the readers will identify  those  unusual  optical  plots  that  can  produce  erroneous  estimates that deviate largely from those determined from the traditional Tauc plot. If possible, the readers will reach a decision to stick to the conventional Tauc plot as the unified UV -Vis optical plot for bandgap energy determination of semiconductors.

various  optical  plot  types  are  presented  in  Table  1.  For  the  optical transmission  measurement  of  ZnO,  the  plot  of α 2 vs. hv yielded  a bandgap value that was essentially the same with the conventional Tauc plot ( α hv ) 2 vs. hv , whereas the plot of α vs. hv failed. For the absorption measurement of β -Ga2O3, the plots of α 2 vs. hv and A 2 vs. hv produced values that were equivalent with the universal Tauc plot, whereas the plots of A vs. hv and α vs. hv failed by overestimating the bandgap up to a magnitude of 0.04 eV when compared with the comprehensive Tauc plot. For the reflectance measurement of β -Ga2O3, the plot of F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv significantly overestimated the bandgap by a magnitude of 0.25 eV, whereas the plot of [ F ( R ∞ ) ] 2 vs. hv underestimated the value by 0.05 eV when compared with the standard Tauc plot.

In the overall, it could be seen that the simple plots of α 2 vs. hv for transmission spectrum, A 2 vs. hv and α 2 vs. hv for absorption spectrum could be used as an alternative to the conventional Tauc plot to obtain reliable bandgap estimates. In the case of reflectance measurement, the comprehensive Tauc plot [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 2 vs . hv appeared to have no alternative method due to the failure of the plots of F ( R ∞ ) vs . hv and [ F ( R ∞ ) ] 2 vs . hv to yield values that were equivalent with those deduced from the ideal Tauc plot.

The bandgap (3.30 eV) of ZnO film derived from the conventional

Tauc plot agrees with the literature value of 3.30 eV (Jubu et al., 2022; Jubu and Yam, 2022). The traditionally observed bandgap (4.43 eV) for the β -Ga2O3 film grown on ITO-glass substrate is less than the intrinsic value of 4.98 eV (Jubu et al., 2022; Winkler et al., 2019; Choi and Kang, 2014). Nevertheless, the recorded bandgap (4.43 eV) is consistent with the literature value range of 5.08 -4.19 eV for β -Ga2O3/glass grown by different synthesis methods (Jubu and Yam, 2022; Winkler et al., 2019; Choi and Kang, 2014). Generally, several factors are reported to affect the bandgap of semiconductors, such as doping, synthesis technique and processing parameters, crystallite size, strain due to mismatch with the lattice of the substrates, film thickness, composition, and others (Jubu and Yam, 2022). The conventionally estimated bandgap (4.99 eV) for the β -Ga2O3 film prepared on Si substrate is consistent with the intrinsic value (4.98 eV) for β -Ga2O3 film produced on an opaque substrate, such as Si (Jubu et al., 2022; Winkler et al., 2019; Choi and Kang, 2014).

## 3. Conclusion

The  present  work  investigated  the  reliability  of  the  uncommonly deployed UV Vis optical plots for estimating the proper bandgap values -of semiconductors. The UV -Vis spectroscopy results of direct bandgap ZnO and β -Ga2O3  semiconducting materials were used for this study.

P.R. Jubu et al.

The conventional Tauc plot ( α hv ) 1 / r vs. hv derived from transmission and absorption spectral and [ F R ( ∞ ) hv ] 1 / r vs. hv derived from diffuse reflectance data were used as the standard method to check the accuracy of the  uncommon  techniques  for  accurate  bandgap  determination  from UV Vis  spectroscopy.  The  direct  bandgap  values  obtained  from  the -unusually deployed plots of α 1 / r vs. hv , and A 1/r vs. hv were found to be essentially same with those deduced from the comprehensive Tauc plot. On the other hand, the direct bandgap values derived from the atypically used plots of α vs. hv , A vs. hv , F ( R ∞ ) vs. hv , and [ F R ( ∞ ) ] 1 / r vs. hv were found to be significantly inconsistent with those determined from the standard Tauc plot. Although some of the uncommon methods produced reasonable bandgap values, it is proposed that the research community should embraced a unified method for estimating the direct and indirect bandgap energy of semiconductors -the universal or comprehensive Tauc plot. This may help to reduce discrepancies in bandgap estimates.
