This work proposed the study of a new lignin/cellulose carbon xerogel/ZnO/Bi2O3/Bi ◦ composite photocatalyst for the degradation of bisphenol-A under sunlight. The reasoning behind the application of each component is based  on  the  formation  of  multiple  heterojunctions  (p-n  heterojunction  between  semiconductors,  metalsemiconductor heterojunction, and carbon-semiconductor heterojunction) to hinder the recombination of photogenerated charges during the photocatalytic process. The lignin/cellulose carbon xerogel was employed as both a solid electron mediator and a reducing agent, promoting the reduction of the bismuth oxide into metallic bismuth. The results obtained from the characterization tests confirm the formation of all the intended phases in the hybrid photocatalyst. Furthermore, the inclusion of the carbon xerogel led to morphological modifications such as the formation of plate-like particles and the increase of specific surface area. The efficient formation of the heterojunctions between the composing phases of the hybrid composite led to an enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of the bisphenol-A (BPA) molecule, under both simulated sunlight and visible light. The optimized composite achieved 84% degradation of the BPA under simulated sunlight and 27% under visible light irradiation, which is a great improvement in comparison to the pure ZnO, which obtained 55% degradation under simulated sunlight and 19% degradation under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the lignin/cellulose  carbon  xerogel/ZnO/Bi2O3/Bi ◦ composite  was  further  verified  by  chronoamperometry  tests, which evidenced its greater photocurrent generation capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

In the past years, industrial activities were responsible for extensive amounts of air, water, and soil pollution, which can have serious consequences for public health, the environment, and global climate change [1 -3]. Therefore, efficient pollution remediation is an essential part of a sustainable future, requiring savvy expertise and innovative solutions. In  this  context,  advanced  oxidation  processes  (AOPs)  have  become increasingly popular as a water treatment strategy over the last decade, owing to their capability to efficiently remediate a wide range of pollutants [4,5]. AOPs are highly efficient at eliminating recalcitrant and toxic organic compounds, suspended solids, and microbial contaminants that may otherwise be resistant to conventional methods [6]. By harnessing the power  of advanced  oxidation  technologies, such as heterogeneous photocatalysis, AOPs can effectively eradicate potential health hazards from wastewater without leaving behind any toxic residuals [7].

The  aforementioned  heterogeneous  photocatalysis  is  a  process whereby light-induced redox reactions can be used to degrade pollutants in water [8]. This technique offers several advantages over traditional methods, such as improved reaction rate, selectivity, stability, and energy  efficiency  [9 -11].  Despite  its  benefits,  heterogeneous  photocatalysis remains underutilized due to cost and complexity constraints, such as low efficiency under sunlight and complex reactor design [10, 12,13]. Nonetheless, this cutting-edge technology still requires further elucidation and refinement before it can fully come into its own as an effective environmental remediation tool.

high efficiency in yielding photodegradation reactions under ultraviolet irradiation [14]. This material has excellent thermal stability, low cost, low toxicity, and robustness compared to other metal oxides, making it an alluring option for applications in this field [15,16]. Moreover, the ZnO photon absorption extends across the ultraviolet and visible range ( λ &lt; 420 nm), which is an advantage over other commonly employed photocatalysts, such as titanium dioxide [17]. However, as most semiconductors used in heterogeneous photocatalysis, this material presents high  recombination  rates  and  low  photoactivity  under  less  energetic wavelengths,  rendering  its  efficient  use  for  sunlight-based  processes unfeasible [18,19].

Heterojunction  design  has  emerged  groundbreaking  approach  to tackling the main disadvantages of photocatalytic materials [20]. It relies on the synergistic combination of two or more dissimilar materials each with their own respective properties and characteristics - to create a  hybrid  material  with  improved  photoactivity.  The  purpose  of  this technique is to facilitate electron-hole pair generation and subsequent separation, allowing for improved conversion efficiency and increased photocatalytic  activity  [21].  Furthermore,  heterojunctions  also  offer greater versatility due to their ability to be tailored with novel combinations that can give rise to specific requirements depending upon the exact application [22]. As an example, p-n heterojunctions capitalize on the distinct properties of both p-type (such as bismuth oxide) and n-type semiconductors to create highly efficient photocatalysts [23]. Due to the formation  of  an  electrical  field  between  the  semiconductors,  photogenerated charges will be separated between the two materials, diminishing  the  recombination  process  [24].  In  the  same  context,  the heterojunction between semiconductors and metals has also been reported  to  satisfyingly  improve  the  photocatalytic  activity  of  hybrid photocatalysts, due to both the plasmonic resonance and Schottky barrier effects, which can promote the formation and separation of photogenerated electrons simultaneously [13,25].

Furthermore, the heterojunction between semiconductors and sustainable  carbonaceous  structures  has  recently  attracted  considerable attention from the scientific community, due to the green nature of this modification. Semiconductors modified with tannin, lignin and cellulose were reported to present improved photocatalytic properties due to the electrical and morphological properties of such carbonaceous structures, with are particularly suitable to enhance charge mobility during photonic activation [26 -28].

Therefore, this paper aims to study the production of a new lignin/ cellulose carbon xerogel/ZnO/Bi2O3/Bi 0 photocatalyst for the efficient photodegradation of bisphenol-A in an aqueous medium, under simulated sunlight. The lignin/cellulose carbon xerogel will be used as both a solid  electron  mediator  and  reduction  agent,  aiming  to  promote  the transformation  of  bismuth  oxide  into  metallic  bismuth  under  high temperatures,  as  reported  by  Moraes  et  al.  when  using  a  tanninformaldehyde carbon xerogel [23].

## 2. Materials and methods

2.1. Synthesis of the lignin/cellulose carbon xerogel/ZnO/Bi2O3/Bi 0 photocatalyst

For the synthesis of this material, firstly, 1 mL of nitric acid (HNO3, 63% w/w) was pipetted into a glass beaker, with the subsequent addition of 0.6 g of bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3 ⋅ 5H2O, 98% m/m). Following the dissolution of the bismuth nitrate, 50 mL of deionized H2O and 20 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (98% m/m) were added, under room temperature and magnetic stirring. In parallel, an aqueous solution (50 mL) was made with 8 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85% w/w), 0.75 g of Kraft lignin, and 0.25 g of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), being kept under stirring for 30 min. This mixture was then added to the zinc/ bismuth nitrate solution, which was then kept under magnetic stirring for another 15 min. The resulting precipitate was filtered, washed with distilled water until neutral pH, and dried in an oven at 100  C for 24 h ◦

The material was then macerated and sieved (325 mesh), added to a closed crucible, and calcined in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere at 700  C for ◦ 1 h, with a heating ramp of 10 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 .  The resulting material was named XCL/ZnO-Bi. Fig. 1 shows a scheme of the synthesis pathway.

Pure zinc oxide (ZnO) was synthesized using the same methodology proposed above, however, no amounts of bismuth nitrate, Kraft lignin, and microcrystalline cellulose were used during the synthesis pathway. The  same  logic  was  applied  to  the  synthesis  of  the  binary  materials (XCL/ZnO and ZnO-Bi).

## 2.2. Characterization

The materials were characterized by: X-ray diffraction (PANalytical X Pert PRO MPD 3060, CuK ' α radiation), scanning electron microscopy (TESCAN MIRA 3 microscope, in the secondary electrons mode), energy dispersive  spectroscopy  (Oxford  INCA  spectrometer  attached  to  a HITACHI TM-3000 microscope), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Shimadzu  UV-2600  spectrophotometer,  with  an  integrating  sphere),  N2 adsorption-desorption  isotherms  (V-Sorb  2600,  GoldAPP)  and  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Specs Phoibos 150, AlK α radiation,  constant energy mode with 10 eV pass energy).

## 2.3. Photocatalytic evaluation

The photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol-A (BPA) was carried out in a jacketed reactor ( h = 0.1 m and di = 0.1 m), using a catalyst dosage of 0.2 g L GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 and 0.5 L of a 10 mg L GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 BPA solution. Before illumination, the reactor was maintained in the dark until the adsorption equilibrium of BPA with the photocatalyst was established. The photocatalytic test was then conducted for a period of 5 h The visible light source was an OSRAM Powerstar 400 W lamp with a UV filter, while the simulated sunlight source was an Osram Ultra Vitalux 300 W lamp. Aliquots were collected during the experiment and centrifuged for 5 min. The BPA concentration was measured in a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer, at the 224 nm wavelength [29].

Employing a 3-electrode electrochemical system, chronoamperometry measurements were conducted on an Autolab Metrohm potentiostat  (model  PGSTAT204).  A  fine  layer  of  each  material  was deposited on an RDE electrode (Pine Research, model AFE3T050PTPK), combined  with  a  platinum  foil  counter  electrode  and  an  Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The studies used a K2SO4  electrolyte aqueous solution (0.1 mol L GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 ) inside a quartz electrochemical cell ( V = 0.2 L) and a potential of 0.8 V ( versus Ag/AgCl). The Osram Ultra Vitalux 300 W was employed to induce photocurrent generation.

The active radical probing tests were performed using the following scavengers:  isopropanol  (5%  v/v, ⋅ OH quenching agent),  gaseous  nitrogen  (0.3  L  min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , O ·GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 inhibitor),  sodium  oxalate  (0.5  mmol  L GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , h + quenching  agent),  and  potassium  chromate  (0.025  mmol  L GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , e GLYPH&lt;0&gt; quenching agent) [30].

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Characterization

Fig.  2  shows  the  X-ray  diffractograms  obtained  for  the  materials synthesized in the present work.

Firstly, Fig. 2A shows that the following crystalline structures are present in the XCL/ZnO-Bi sample:

- (a) Hexagonal structure of zinc oxide (Wurtzite), with peaks positioned at the 2 θ angles of 31.8, 34.4, 36.3, 47.5, 56.6, 62.9, 66.6, ˚ ˚ ˚ ˚ ˚ ˚ ˚ 68.0, and 69.2, which can be related to the reflection planes (1 ˚ ˚ 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0), (1 0 3), (2 0 0), (1 1 2) and (2 0 1), respectively [29].

- (b) β -Bi2O3  tetragonal  structure,  with  peaks  positioned  at  the  2q values of 28 , 30.3 , 32.75 , 46.3 , and 55.6 ; with the respective ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ ◦ reflection planes: (2 2 1), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (4 0 2) and (6 2 1) [31].
- (c)  Rhombohedral structure of metallic bismuth (Bi ), with peaks at 0 the 2 θ positions of 27.2 , 38.1 , and 39.7 ◦ ◦ ◦ and related reflection planes of (0 1 2), (1 0 4), and (1 1 0) [32].

Thus, the heterojunctions present in the structure of the XCL/ZnO-Bi can  be  described  as  p-n  heterojunctions  between  ZnO  and  Bi2O3, metallic  heterojunctions  based  on  the  Bi 0 and  carbon-semiconductor heterojunctions. Consequently, a facilitated charge transfer during the photocatalytic process is expected for this material, which will probably result in an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.

However, it is noticeable that  the  binary  ZnO-Bi  material  is  only formed by the ZnO and β -Bi2O3 phases. Therefore, it is evident that the presence  of  carbon  xerogel  was  necessary  for  the  formation  of  the metallic bismuth phase. It was previously reported that the tannin-based carbon xerogel was able to promote the reduction of the Bi2O3 into Bi 0 at high temperatures and, therefore, the same process was probably conducted  by  the  lignin/cellulose  carbon  xerogel  during  the  thermal treatment of the XCL/ZnO-Bi [23]. Finally, the ZnO and XCL/ZnO only displayed the formation of the hexagonal phase of ZnO, as expected.

The Rietveld analysis of the XCL/ZnO-Bi shows a mass composition of 97.7% ZnO, 1.7% β -Bi2O3,  and 0.6% of Bi , whereas the ZnO-Bi is 0 composed of 98.7% ZnO and 1.3%  -Bi2O3. Therefore, it seems that the β bismuth content on the ZnO-Bi was not completely crystallized in the form of β -Bi2O3, remaining as an amorphous phase. In such a case, an elevated rate of photogenerated charges recombination will likely be caused by the high number of bulk defects present in this amorphous structure, lowering the material s photocatalytic efficiency [33 ' -35].

To further analyze the structure of the XCL/ZnO-Bi, XPS analysis was performed. The results are shown in Fig. 3.

The bismuth spectrum (Fig. 3A) may be deconvoluted into 4 bands, with the two strongest being related to the 4f5/2  (164.6 eV) and 4f7/2 (159.2 eV) modes of the bismuth oxide in the sample [36]. The peaks with lesser intensity can be related to the 4f5/2  (162.6 eV) and 4f7/2 (157.3 eV) modes of metallic bismuth (Bi ) [32]. For the zinc element 0 (Fig. 3B), the peaks of the 2p1/2 (1045 eV) and 2p3/2 (1021.9 eV) modes of Zn 2 + can be observed, as expected, due to the presence of zinc oxide [37]. The deconvoluted peaks of the carbon spectrum (Fig. 3C) can be related to the C -C bonds (284.4 eV), O -C = O (289 eV), and the C -O bond related to the formation of zinc oxycarbides between the carbon xerogel and the zinc oxide (285.6 eV) [17]. Finally, it is possible to identify in the oxygen spectrum (Fig. 3D) the Zn-O and Bi-O (531 eV) bondings of the oxides  present  in  the  material,  in  addition  to  bands related to the functional groups present in the carbon xerogel [17,38].

morphological  alteration  for  the  XCL/ZnO  and  XCL/ZnO-Bi,  as  both materials  containing  the  carbon  xerogel  are  formed  by  a  mixture  of particles  in  the  form  of  plates  and  smaller  particle  aggregates.  This behavior  will  likely  result  in  an  increased  interface  for  the  photocatalytic reactions and may be one of the factors that will grant a greater photocatalytic activity to the XCL/ZnO and XCL/ZnO-Bi materials.

Fig.  5  shows  the  element  mapping  obtained  for  the  XCL/ZnO-Bi, obtained through the energy dispersive spectroscopy technique.

Observing  Fig.  5,  it  is  noticeable  that  all  of  the  components  are adequately dispersed throughout the surface of the XCL/ZnO-Bi, which facilitates the transfer of photogenerated charges through the heterojunctions during the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, concentration points  of  bismuth  are  seen,  which  are  associated  with areas  of  higher  clarity  in  the  original  microscopy.  This  behavior  is typical of the presence of metals on the material s surface and, therefore, ' it is  reasonable  to  say  that  such  concentration  points  are  mainly composed of metallic bismuth [47 -49].

Fig. 6 shows the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for the XCL/ZnO-Bi and ZnO-Bi materials.

The isotherms obtained for the materials can be classified as type IVH3, according to the isotherms classification provided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. These isotherms indicate that the materials are composed of non-rigid particles agglomerates with slit-shaped pores. The same characteristic was observed for the ZnO and XCL/ZnO, as reported by de Moraes et al. [27]. Table 2 exhibits the parameters calculated for each sample according to their N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.

First, it is noticed an increase in the specific surface area and pore volume for the ZnO-Bi due to the inclusion of the bismuth fraction to the pure ZnO. This was probably due to the difference between the ionic radii of zinc and bismuth, which may have caused the deformation of the crystalline lattice and some superficial texturization [50]. The inclusion of the carbon xerogel also resulted in enhanced surface area and pore volume for the XCL/ZnO, however, the further inclusion of the bismuth fraction led to a small reduction in the specific surface area, probably due to the consumption of the carbon xerogel by the bismuth oxide reduction reaction. However, all modified materials presented enhanced parameters when compared to the pure ZnO, which is favorable to their photocatalytic performance due to an increased interface region available  to  propagate  the  superficial  processes  involved  in  the  photonic

activation of the materials.

Fig.  7  presents  the  diffuse  reflectance  spectrum  of  the  materials, along with the Tauc plot for bandgap energy determination [51].

ZnO-Bi presented the worst efficiency among the materials, which is probably due to the absence of the carbon xerogel and Bi 0 phases, along with the amorphous bismuth mass fraction.

All the diffuse reflectance spectra obtained for the materials show the characteristic absorption edge of the zinc oxide, located for wavelengths lower  than  420  nm  [52].  Furthermore,  the  inclusion  of  the  carbon xerogel boosted the XCL/ZnO and XCL/ZnO-Bi composites ' capacity to absorb visible light, which is a characteristic behavior of carbonaceous materials [21]. The Kubelka-Mink plot (Fig. 7B) shows that no major modification of the bandgap energy was obtained for the materials by the modifications performed, as all values of Egap were close to 3.25 eV

## 3.2. Photocatalytic evaluation

Fig. 8 shows the results of the bisphenol-A photodegradation tests for the materials studied in this work, under simulated sunlight and visible light irradiation.

As described in Section 2.3, the experiments were carried out in the dark until the adsorption-desorption equilibrium was reached. However, after 30 min, no measurable adsorption of bisphenol-A was achieved by the photocatalysts.

The results of the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol-A confirm that the XCL/ZnO-Bi presented the best photocatalytic activity among the  materials  evaluated  in  this  work,  for  the  simulated  sunlight  and visible light photodegradation tests. This result is mainly derived from its  superior  morphological  properties  and  the  synergy  between  the heterojunctions formed during the synthesis of the composite, which promoted facilitated charge carrier separation and transport throughout the photocatalytic experiment. It is also interesting to notice that the

To contextualize the results obtained in this work, it is possible to compare the results obtained with the tannin-based carbon xerogel/ZnO composite  previously  reported  by  de  Moraes  et  al.  [29].  The  study, which was performed using the same experimental setup, reported a BPA  degradation  of  62%  under  simulated  sunlight  and  20%  under visible light irradiation for the tannin-based carbon xerogel/ZnO composite synthesized in an aqueous medium. Therefore, it seems that the lignin/cellulose  carbon  xerogel  is  a  suitable  choice  to  improve  the photocatalytic activity of the pure zinc oxide, as the results presented in this work for the XCL/ZnO were superior for both radiation types tested (72% for simulated sunlight and 22% for visible light).

Furthermore, Table 3 gathers the results for BPA photodegradation obtained in multiple works reported by the related literature.

The kinetic evaluation of the bisphenol-A photodegradation reaction was performed using the so-called pseudo-first-order model [57]. The results obtained are displayed in Table 4.

The results of the kinetic evaluation show that the pseudo-first-order model can be used to describe the bisphenol-A photodegradation reaction satisfyingly, as all the values of R 2 are fairly close to 1. Furthermore, the XCL/ZnO-Bi emerges with the highest values of apparent reaction rate  constant  ( kapp ), confirming  its  higher  efficiency  in  the  BPA photodegradation.

Fig.  9  shows  the  results  of  the  chronoamperometry  tests  for  the photocatalysts studied in this work.

Chronoamperometry studies for photocatalysts show that the XCL/ ZnO-Bi  has  the  highest  photocurrent  generation  capacity,  further

proving its superiority as a sunlight-based photocatalyst. Therefore, it is clear that the addition of the bismuth phases and the lignin/cellulose carbon  xerogel  led  to  a  facilitated  formation  and  transfer  of  charge carriers, diminishing the recombination phenomena and boosting the XCL/ZnO-Bi photocatalytic activity [58,59].

Fig. 10A shows the absorption spectra of the bisphenol-A samples collected during the photodegradation experiment using the XCL/ZnOBi under simulated sunlight, whereas Fig. 10B exhibits the results obtained through the scavenger probing methodology to determine the active radical generation mechanism for the XCL/ZnO-Bi photocatalyst.

of the experiment. For the bisphenol-A molecule, the possible intermediate formed during the process is 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, which has an absorption peak located at 256 nm [60]. It is also clear that at the end of the experiments, the presence of this intermediate molecule is no longer perceived in the obtained spectra, implying that the intermediate was degraded during the photodegradation reaction.

Observing Fig. 10A, it is noticeable that a small increase in absorption for the wavelengths between 240 and 260 nm occurred in the course

As for the mechanism of active radical generation, Fig. 10B exhibits that the hydroxyl active radical is the one most responsible for the BPA degradation  under  simulated  sunlight,  as  the  reaction  was  almost completely suppressed when using the isopropanol as a hydroxyl scavenger. The generation of superoxide radicals also inhibited the process to  some  extent,  implying  that  this  radical  is  somehow  linked  to  the

hydroxyl generation mechanism during the photocatalytic experiment. Therefore, the subsequent mechanism for active radical generation is proposed (Eqs. (1) -(7)) [61]:

The  proposed  active  radical  mechanism  can  be  explained  in  the following manner: considering the p-n heterojunction, a region with an internal electrical field will be generated at the heterojunction between the ZnO and the β -Bi2O3, due to the transfer of electrons from the material with higher Fermi level (ZnO) to the material with lower Fermi level  ( β -Bi2O3),  which  will  lead  to  the  Fermi  level  stabilization  and distortion of the conduction and valence bands at the contact region [23, 62]. Due to the formation of the internal electrical field, electron holes generated during photonic activation will be transferred to the valence band of the  -BiO2 (EVB β = 2.75 eV), which can promote the formation of hydroxyl radicals through the oxidation of adsorbed water molecules (E 0 = 2.3 V vs. NHE). On the other hand, the photogenerated will be transferred to the conduction band of the ZnO (ECB = -0.32 eV), which is capable to promote the reduction of adsorbed oxygen molecules to superoxide radicals (E 0 = -0.285 V vs. NHE) [23,62]. This scheme can be observed in Fig. 11. Furthermore, both the metallic bismuth and the carbon  xerogel  have  the  ability  to  capture  photogenerated  electrons during  photonic  activation,  further  enhancing  charge  separation  and

Finally, Fig. 12 shows the recycling test for the XCL/ZnO-Bi in order to evaluate its reuse capabilities in the BPA photodegradation tests.

The results displayed in Fig. 12 show that the XCL/ZnO-Bi has good reuse properties for the degradation test evaluated in the present work, as  no  efficiency  loss  was  verified  after  three  BPA  photodegradation cycles.

## 4. Conclusion

The  use  of  kraft  lignin  and  cellulose  as  carbonaceous  precursors proved to be an effective strategy for the production of the composite proposed in this work, as the inclusion of the carbon xerogel was of paramount importance to drive the beneficial modifications observed in the XCL/ZnO-Bi, which presented greater photoactivity than its counterparts for the bisphenol-A photodegradation tests. The apparent reaction rate constants ( kapp ) obtained by the XCL/ZnO-Bi were increased approximately twofold when compared to the values obtained by the pure ZnO, for both types of light irradiation investigated. This improved efficiency was related to the development of multiple heterojunction types  during  the  synthesis  pathway  (semiconductor-semiconductor, semiconductor-metal, and semiconductor-carbon xerogel), as well as the increase in specific surface area and morphological modification, with the formation of plate-shaped particles. Furthermore, the mechanism of BPA degradation using the XCL/ZnO-Bi photocatalyst was completely based on the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Finally, the XCL/ZnO-Bi presented good reusability properties, which is ideal for applications in real wastewater treatment processes.
