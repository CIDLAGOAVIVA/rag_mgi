Abstract. Facing an increasing violence level and higher firepower in the hands of criminal organizations (especially those related to drug trafficking), the Military Police of Pernambuco has created, in 1989, the '1ª Companhia  Independente  de  Operações  Especiais'  (1 st Independent  Company  of  Special  Operations),  as  a  tactical  last resort of the Police to be used on special, complex situations. The CIOE progressively makes use of Negotiation measures,  of  less-than-lethal  maneuvers,  of  Precision  Shots  and  Tactical  Assaults.  When  all  possibilities  are drained, the Precision Shot will bring the crisis perpetrator down. This study had as an objective to assess the level of impact noise suffered by the elite snipers of the 1 st CIOE-PE in their training. The working conditions of the snipers were evaluated through the use of a semi-structured questionnaire.  Noise measuring was done on four (4) .308 IMBEL AGLC (with ammo from the same lot) rifles. Six (6) shots were fired off each gun, separated by a 30-second pause. In the end, it has been concluded that the noise level the 1 st CIOE snipers are submitted to is considered to be normal by Brazilian legislation.

Keywords: occupational assessment on noise, police snipers, firearms

## 1.  Introduction

The  context  on  which  violence  has  appeared  in Brazil (and on foreign grounds) is intricate and complex. It is clear that the current social zeitgeist is that.

ing   to  intervene  on  and  minimize  social  conflicts, * which  complexity  demands  a  special,  unordinary treatment.

Torna-se manifesto que o pensamento modulador das  configurações  sociais  mais  recentes  emana  de executivos  das  grandes  empresas  e  seus  assemelhados no comando político. Os super-ricos, indivíduos, grupo  ou  nações  podem  operar  sem  consideração  a outros interesses que não os seus.

In this scene, the explicitly criminal organizations thrive.  Organized  gangs  quickly  spread  and  easily acquire heavy firearms, while the mob and drug traffic  go  global  and  replace  governments  of  neighborhoods, cities and even entire countries.

As  a  result,  huge  parts  of  the  national  populace that are poor and are not a part of any criminal organizations tend to become the main victims, being exposed  to  prejudice  and  becoming  devoid  of  basic citizen rights. [3]

In  this  context,  the  Brazilian  government  makes haste  to  better  equip  the  national  Police  force,  aim-

In  Pernambuco,  through  State  Decree  n.14.147 (september  18th,  1989),  The  '1ª  Companhia  Independente  de  Operações  Especiais  -  1ª  CIOE'  was created as the police's last tactical resort, acting when unordinary  and  extremely  complex  situations  occurred.

The  State  Military  Organizations  of  such  nature are considered to be of major duty, acting in hostage situations, kidnappings,  counter-terrorist and  antibomb threats  through  the  progressive  usage  of  four tactical alternatives, those being the Negotiation, the Use of less-than-lethal techniques, the Precision Shot and the Tactical Assault. The Precision Shot requires a permanent training routine for the sniper due to its highly  demanding  nature.  Due  to  its  lethality,  it  is paramount that the Precision Shot must only be taken after  strict  authorization  by  the  Commander  of  the troops,  and  only  when  all  other  previous  non-lethal ways prove unfruitful.

The 1  CIOE is currently made of 87 (Eighty sevst en)  military  policemen  (both  officers  and  recruits), all of which have passed through extensive specialization courses, and 5 (five) of those are official snipers.  [9]

## 2. Objectives

To investigate the CIOE sniper's exposition to the impact noise originated from rifle blasts  on  training grounds,  and  to  conduct  proposals  in  order  to  mitigate any possible problems.

## 2.1. Specific Objectives

- /g16 Identify  specific  characteristics  of  the  Sniper's training grounds.
- /g16 To  quantitatively  assess  the  noise  produced  by the .308 IMBEL AGLC rifle.
- /g16 To  find  a  standard  between  the  norms  and  the results obtained in the study.
- /g16 Evaluate  control  measures  and,  if  necessary, suggest improvements.

## 3. Impact Noise

Despite the growing importance impact noise has seen due to the risk it symbolizes to the human being, there  is  still  not  an  established  consensus  between international norms in order to establish its definition and evaluation.

In SILVA, in [8], the following definitions for impact noise can be found:

ISO-1999(1989): Sound phenomena of high level and inferior to 1sec in lenght.

Norma OSHA(1996): Sound with a rising time inferior  to  35ms,  referring  to  peak  intensity,  with  a Lenght inferior than 500ms and a repetition time of 1s.

NIOSH(1998a): Characterized by a sudden elevation and quick sound level decrease, being less than a second in lenght.

NR15- Anexo 2(Editora Atlas,2000) e Fundacentro (1999): Level of sound with a lenght equivalent of less  than  a  second  and  intervals  (in  between  them) that are higher than 1sec in length.

In  Brazil,  the  criteria  utilized  to  evaluate  impact noise is showcased by NR15-Anexo 2, which preconizes that the evaluation must be realized with a meter  bearing  an  appropriate  time  constant  and  with  a linear ponderation. The established threshold for this configuration  is  130  dB.  In  case  the  correct  equipment  to  evaluate  impact  noise  is  unavailable,  the norm indicates the use of the time constant 'FAST', with a ponderation of 'C'. The accepted threshold, in such a situation, is that of 120 dB. The time constant stands  for  the  speed  with  which  the  instrument  responds to time pressure oscillations, and the 'FAST' constant corresponds to 125ms.

## 4. Hearing losses  originating from shooting firearms

The use of firearms in bellicose activities since the invention of gunpowder (circa the XIV century) contributes a lot to increase hearing losses instigated by noise (COSTA, et al, in [8]). The sudden hearing loss brought upon by a high intensity (but lacking length) noise  (like  an  explosion  or  detonation)  is  named 'acoustic  trauma',  and  may  cause  severe  structural harm to the both middle and inner ear.

A big acoustic trauma may lead to rupture of the tympanic  membrane  and/or  disarticulation  of  the bone  chain,  which  may  be  eventually  corrected  by surgical procedures.

In Brazil, in the year 2000, a research took place. It  was  about the hearing of the Escola de Formação Militar para  Sargentos  (Military  School  for  Sergeants), with an involvement of 502 male individual, between the ages of 16 and 23 years. In the 20-month period  between  the  course's  beginning  and  end,  it was noticed that 24,5% of the total had hearing losses [7]. In an evaluation of the audiologic profile of the Military Policemen of Minas Gerais, in a span of 34 male  policemen  between  the  ages  of  24  an  55, 28,57% of the 7 participating snipers were shown to have PAINPSE. [16]

Its  worth  noticing  that,  according  to  researches made  to  measure  the  level  of  impact  noise  brought upon  by  the FAL  (Portuguese:  Light  Automatic Rifle) used by units of the national army, the results pointed out numbers above the maximum level of the measuring  devices utilized (that being 135  dB), which  proves  that  the  use  of  protective  plug-type device from 3M, for an example, with a real level of noise  reduction  (NRRsf)  equal  to  12  dB  is  not  efficient  enough  to  ensure  the  user's  hearing  security.[12]

In a study made with 41 army men, ages around 31 to 51 years, basic audiologic evaluation detected that

39% had normal hearing and 61% already had hearing losses. [15]

There's  a  considerable  difference  (which  varies from individual to individual) when it comes to susceptibility to noise. Some people have "resistant" ears and thus can tolerate way higher noise levels without suffering  harm,  while  others  are  more  sensible  and get  hurt,  even when exposed to less noise. The best examples  are  identified  within  the  military:  Some suffer  frequent  hearing  losses  after  a  firing  session, while  others  show  a  past  of  more  regular  exposure without having noticeable damage. [14]

In the scope of the bibliographical review that took place,  it  can  be  understood  that  Hearing  Damage  is much more frequent in people working for the military.

## 5. Police Snipers precision

In  Brazil  the  use  of  sharpshooters  in  police  cases occurred  occasionally.  From  the  creation  of  GATE (Group of Tactical Actions Spe-cial) in the Military Police  of  São  Paulo,  August  4,  1988,  and  had  the support  of  teachers  of  the  North  American  SWAT teaching of tactics special is that teams were organized -sniper tactics and precision weapons. [10]

## 6. The selection of the police sniper precision

In  Brazil,  the  employment  of  snipers  in  police issues  was  occasional.  After  the  creation  of  GATE (Grupo  de  Operações  Táticas  Especiais  -  Special Tactics  Operation  Group)  in  the  Military  Police  of the  state  of  São  Paulo,  in  August  4th,  1988,  (which was supported by north-American SWAT instructors who  taught  the  discipline  of  special  tactics),  the creation and organization of sniper tactic groups went common-place. [10]

## 7. The sorting of the Police sniper

It is not enough to be an excellent shooter in order to  be  a  police  sniper.  The  policeman  must  be  an operative  of  the  tactic  group  for  at  least  two  years and  take  every  training  of  its  team.  It  is  extremely important that he/she is acquainted to all operational procedures of his/her unit, for to be successful in the missions  he/she  is  to  partake  in,  he  must  know  the objectives of the team and know how it will act, so he/she  can  provide  the  correct  support.  Due  to  skill and  training,  when  necessary,  the  shooter  can  take part  in  other  functions  of  the  group,  such  as  tactic assault. [1]

The  sorting  of  the  policemen  must  be  judicious, for when pulling the trigger, in a matter of seconds, the sniper may become a hero or a villain before its superiors  and  society,  all  depending  on  the  shot's result. If it's  a  hit,  there's  satisfaction  for  all  and  the corp.'s image is highlighted, but if it's a miss, a career gets ruined and the corp.'s reputation and image are tarnished. [5]

The elite sniper is always the first to come and the last to leave in a crisis situation. To be a police sniper, beside  the  mentioned  requirements,  the  candidate must  have  certain  qualifications  which  are  not  normally  necessary  for  policemen  or  even  to  other members of tactic groups, such as: It is not enough to be an excellent shooter in order to be a police sniper. The  policeman  must  be  an  operative  of  the  tactic group  for  at  least  two  years  and  partake  in  every training  of  its  team.

## 8. The commitment to kill

We transcribed  the  explanation  within  the  monography of [1]

[...]  In  this  situation  it  is  needed to tell the candidate that it is possible that, in any given moment of

his career as a sniper, he may have to kill someone in order  to  keep  somebody  else's  right  to  live,  and  it there  is  hesitation  over  this  commitment,  he  will  be seriously  jeopardizing  the  lives  of  his  companions and  of  the  people  he  has  the  constitutional  duty  to protect.

## 9. Other qualifications a sniper needs to have or to be

- /g16 Not very emotive.
- /g16 Higher-than-average intelligence.
- /g16 Meticulous and capable of working with a team.
- /g16 Excellent memory and physical fitness.
- /g16 Non-addicted individuals.
- /g16 Above-average, eagle-eyed shooter.
- /g16 Motivation,  initiative,  discipline,  commonsense and patience.

## 11. Noise control measures

Publications  disclose  that  the  major  part  of  subjects who've shown hearing losses were not adequately protected: As in, for an example, the work of [17], where 17,71% did not use any kind of protection and 46,88% use only cotton as a protection device. Konopka  and  team  (2002),  quoted  by  [13],  have  analyzed ten 20-year soldiers who were not guarded by noise-protective devices and exposed to impact noise brought  upon  by  automatic  firearms  and  have  detected alterations in the hearing of these individuals. Temmel  and  collaborators  (1999),  also  quoted  by [13], have made a study regarding the acoustic trauma brought upon by impact noise in military rookies and  found  out  that  80%  were  not  using  protective devices by the time the acoustic trauma took place.

## 11.1. Control in the level of the noise receptor (PA)

The studies made regarding the use of the PA consider it as a last resource for ear protection. However, its use by the sniper is the only possible way to diminish impact noise on these individuals.

Considering  that  every  PA  diminished  the  noise forming a barrier do reduce any sound coming for the tympanic membrane, the level of protection depends on  the  PA's  gasket  level.  (TOIVONEN  et  al.,  2002 and GERGES, 1996) quoted by [2].

There are various types of auricular protection devices (Portuguese: PA), that can be used according to the wished application. The most common are: shellshaped Earplugs and regular plugs. Simply giving the product is generally not enough to ensure the protection  against  aggressive  agents,  a  wider  awareness  is also  needed  through  trainings  that  explain  how  to correctly use and clean those. [17]

## 12. Norms and legistlation of work safety regarding noise

In  Brazilian  legislation,  regarding  the  safety  and work medicine, the Norma Reguladora nº 15 (1978) (Norm of Regulation number 15) sets limits of tolerance  for recurring, intermittent and  impact-based noise. On Anexo II (Attachment II) is where limits of tolerance  for  impact  noise  are  covered.  When  not filtered by a PA or another protective device, impact noise of level above 140dB (measured on the circuit of  noise  response,  or  130dB  when  measured  a  fastresponding  circuit,  named  "FAST")  is  considered

dangerous. Exposition to various risk factors inside a productive  procedure  demands  levels  of  caution  in order to minimize such risks, be it related to the very nature of the procedure, or to the environment itself, the surroundings. NR-06 makes it clear that employers must make protective gear (Portuguese: EPI) freely  available,  but  the  Army  does  not  have  NR-06  an imperative norm, therefore carries out activities that leave the soldier without assistance when it comes to safety. It was noted, and later acknowledged by study subjects,  that  ear  protection  devices  were  not  distributed  free  of  charge  to  the  rookies  during  firearms training. (GOMIDE, 2004, quoted by [13]

## 13. Meter for sound pressure level

This  device  is  called  a  sound  level  meter  (Portuguese:  Decibelímetro,  or  Sonômetro).  The  device  is comprised  of  the  following  basic  elements:  Microphone, Pre-Amplifier, adjustment options, amplifier, meter  equipped  with  a  very  precise  sound  pressure circuit to obtain values (Portuguese: r.m.s) with constants named slow, fast and impulse, and a terminal for delivery of data. The microphone has a transducer which  transforms  sound  waves  into  electric  pulses which,  when  amplified,  are  utilized  in  the  calculations of the r.m.s by a circuit dedicated to such function,  which  transforms  the  pulses  into  a  logarithm and applies the considerations which will result in the value/level of sound pressure, in dB, instantly. There are also the time constants that symbolize the speed with which the device perceives the sound wave oscillations.  These  constants  are  normalized  as  slow ( 1s), fast ( 125ms) and impulse ( 35ms).

All sound pressure meters must obey the international norms when it comes to frequency ponderation curves, to the constants of exposure time and to the directional  characteristics  of  the  microphone.  The equipments for noise measuring must be periodically submitted to calibration in laboratory.

## 14. Research Methodology

In  this  topic,  the  monographic  work  was  developed under two scopes, being the Bibliographical and the Field Researches, as follows:

## 14.1. Bibliographical Research

The bibliographical research was done by the aid of  technical  and  literary  consulting  on  the  characteristics  of  the  Inbel  AGLC  .380  WIN  Rifle,  on  the activities of the sniper and the precision shot, as well as the legal answer of the action. Regarding the noise, researches  were  done  on  the  areas  of  Safety  and Work Medicine and Speech Therapy,  all  applied  to the study of impact noise as well as the surveying of current norms and legislations.

## 14.2. Field Research

The beginning of the survey on the Sniper's training  activities  was  guided  by  the  recommendation given by [6], wherein the following information lies:

" In order to make an analysis of a working place, it  is  necessary  to  "sweep"  the  area  in  order  to  find sources of danger, that is, inherent risks generated by the  sources  and  determine  each  one:  What  may  go wrong;  when  and  how  long;  what  would  be  the  effects  and  consequences.  On  the  field  research,  the following data was collected: Analysis of the Sniper training grounds with a description and measuring of the  environment;  surveying  of  the  activities  developed  during  the  shooting  training  based  on  on-site studies,  with  description  of  the  functions  and  interviews  with  the  shooters.  Preemptive  measures  were taken in consideration. The sound level meter DEC460 from INSTRUTHERM was used for the quantitative evaluation of the impact noise levels.

## 15. Results

## 15.1. Questionnaires

The research involving the elite snipers of the 1st CIOE-PE was done through a semi-structured questionnaire, containing 16 objective questions and 1 for free answers. The research revealed a group of men with ages ranging from 35 to 40 years and a medium of  38  years.  Relating  their  weights  and  heights  we found body mass indexes (Portuguese: IMC) between 18,5  -  24,9,  which  is  considered  to  be  healthy  and normal. The index is determined by dividing the individual's mass by the quarter of his height, on which the mass is expressed in kilograms and height in meters.

Everyone of them have more than 10 years of service on the Military Police of Pernambuco and only

one of them with less than 10 years in service of the 1st CIOE. On sniper duties, four of them have been doing  this  for  06  to  10  years,  and  one  for  01  to  05 years.  All  of  them  completed  high  school  or  more and have completed, at least, the "Sniper" and "Approaching  Techniques"  by  COPE  -  Curso  de  Operações Policiais Especiais (Portuguese: Special Police Operations Course). The training/shooting routine is done from 02 to 04 times a week, with a succession of  20  to  25  shots  fired  and  being  01  to  02  hours  in duration/length.

As  the  main  characteristic  of  their  training,  04 considered  it  as  challenging  and  01  as  competitive, with no one choosing the options "part of a routine" or  "tiring".  All  opted  for  concentration  as  the  item that  leaves  the  greatest  mark  on  the  training,  with opting  for  "tension"  or  "stress".  When  it  came  to noise  perception,  04  said  it  was  bearable  and  01 called  it  strong,  with  none  calling  it  "disturbing"  or "too  strong".  On  the  matter  of  how  they  consider their  hearing  when  compared  to  others  their  age, every answered "good". The entire group went through periodic medical exams provided by the Military Police, but didn't have any hearing exams, with the  last  ones  being  appointed  between  02  and  05 years ago. During training, shooters always use earplugs for protection, but there's no tradition of using two  types  at  once.  They  all  declare  that  company's current protective gear policy is good. Finally, it was asked of them what they would like to see improved on  training  grounds,  and  they  said  the  company should  make  silicone  earplugs  in  the  shape  of  each shooter due to a better adjustment and a better noise reduction.

## 15.2. Training Grounds.

The  1st  CIOE-PE  Snipers  train  in  an  open  field, close  to  the  company's  headquarters.  The  training grounds are more or less a hundred meters from the headquarters  building.  The  place  is  30m²  long  and paved with cobblestones, where the shooters gear up to  train,  always  crouched  to  the  ground.  From  the paved area there is a corridor approximately 15 meters  long  and  100  meters  in  length  up  to  a  barrier where  the  targets  are  located.  There's  no  buildings less than 50 meters from the place, being only short and  medium-height  trees  located  at  more  than  10 meter  from  where  the  shooters  take  their  places, therefore  not  being  a  barrier  that  can  reflect  sound waves. Trainings are done individually.

## 16.  The measuring

The measuring of impact noise from the shots was made  using  a  sound  level  meter  from  INSTRUTHERM, MODEL DEC-460-SOUND LEVEL MASTER,  Nº  of  the  bar  code  /  Nº  serial  number: 05091500071903  /  05043420.  The  measuring  was done in each one of the 04 .308 IMBEL AGLC rifles from 1st CIOE-PE, considered to be standard by the company, and with specific ammunition coming from the same lot, as described:

RIFLE 762 - AGLC - Nº AK 00101 - 3741

RIFLE 762 - AGLC - Nº AK 00088 - 5351

RIFLE 762 - AGLC - Nº AK 00102 - 3999

RIFLE 762 - AGLC - Nº AK 00098 - 557

The ammo used: M1 FULL METAL JAC -168g, LOT 2128/ 2009-CBC.

06 shots were fired with each gun, with 30 second intervals between each one, with 06 measuring being made, 03 on the left ear and 03 on the right. After 03 shots,  according to the charts below, a medium was considered,  therefore  generating  01  value  each  ear per rifle.

In all cases, the measuring of the impact noise was made with the sound level meter  adjusted  on  the  C circuit  and  in  the  fast-response  circuit  ("FAST"),  as per norm NR 15, in the 2º annex.

Table 2 Final results obtained

|   RIFLE | MEASUREMENT  LEFT EAR   | MEASUREMENT RIGHT  EAR   |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
|       1 | 97,47± 0,76dB           | 97,57± 0,33dB            |
|       2 | 98,33± 0,74dB           | 99,07± 0,17dB            |
|       3 | 98,93± 0,17dB           | 98,10± 0,22dB            |
|       4 | 99,27± 1,32dB           | 99,40± 0,40dB            |

The medium of the background noise found in the area  was  equivalent  to  MF  =  44,35  dB,  which  does not influence the above results.

## 17. Discussion on the results

According  to  the  results  (Table2),  it  can  be  said that  the  measuring  of  the  impact  noise  produced  by the  ammo  detonation  from  the  .308  IMBEL  AGLC rifles  reveal  values  that  are  relatively  low  for  firearms, and that the measuring on the shooter level, on

both ears, are pretty much identical. However, when using the automatic rifle - FAL, caliber 7.62mm, the military shooters of the Brazilian Army are exposed to  a  minimum  pressure  level  of  147,30  dB,  with  a chance  this  value  might  reach  171  dB.  147,  30  DB was the maximum possible value the device used in the  research  could  register.  The  value  or  171  dB  is provided by the Revista Brasileira  de Otorrinolaringologia  (Brazilian  Magazine  of  Otorhinolaryngology),  as  the  pressure  corresponding  to  the  automatic, light rifle. [11]

It  is  verified that the great difference between the sound pressure generated by two mentioned weapons is  that:  on  the  automatic  and  semi-automatic  rifles, like the FAL, the expulsion of the projectile and the reloading are made by the effect of action and reaction  of  the  gases  originated  from  the  firing,  that  is, when there is pressure to oust the projectile through the barrel of the gun, the gases make equal pressure onto the back of the ammo shell, which then pushes back the mechanism that will replace the ammo for a new shot.

In this recoiling process the FAL gets open, allowing  the  exit,  through  the  back,  of  part  of  the  gases originated  by  the  detonation,  generating  a  sound pressure of 147,30 dB or more, to the shooter.[9]

Basically, every rifle used by the elite shooters are reloaded manually and that such an action, by action of a deadbolt, is held as something that grants additional precision to the shot, for it provides laying of the shell in a more consistent and firm way.

So,  in  the  firing  of  a  manually  reloaded  rifle,  by reaction  the  gases  of  the  blast  also  force  the  shell behind, but the deadbolt that fastens the grip does not allow any recoil to the shell, and so there is no exit of gases through the back, which makes the blast gases go  only  through  the  front,  reducing  the  sound  pressure the sniper gets submitted to. [9]

NR15, on the 2º annex, determines that the level of sound  pressure  from  the  blast  (measured  on  the  C circuit and in the fast-response circuit "FAST") must be under the threshold of 120 dB (C)

## 18. Conclusions

In conclusion, the impact noise resulting from the training of the Snipers from the 1st CIOE-PE is under the limits preconized by Brazilian legislation. When done  individually  and  with  the  use  of  devices  for hearing protection, the activity should not causa permanent hearing damage to these professionals.

Stressing  that  the  debate  over  the  evaluation  of  impact noise is still relevant and open, and acknowledging that the training of an elite shooter is a constant throughout his entire working life, which may represent  an  excess  above  100.000  shots  fired,  it  is reccommended the use of double protection through the  utilization  of  both  ordinary  plugs  and  earplugs, also,  their  pleas  for  silicone-based  earplugs  should also be answered, as to guarantee a mitigation greater than 10 dB on the noise they are submitted to.
