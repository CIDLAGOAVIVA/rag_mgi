## 1 Introduction

The first 3D printing was developed in the 80s and was initially used for prototyping and  modelling.  In  recent  years,  with  advancements  in  technology,  3D  printing  has become more accessible and available to a wide range of users, including individual users and small businesses [1]. Since its development by S. Scott Crump, FDM (Fused Deposition Modelling) has become the mostly used AM technology (Fig. 1). FDM is a type of 3D printing technology. According to the ASTM F42 (Additive Manufacturing Technologies), this process can also be called as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) or material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM). It works by heating and extruding thermoplastic filaments (plastic materials) which are then deposited layer by layer to build  up  a  3D  object.  The  melted  material  is  extruded  through  a  small  nozzle  onto a build platform where it cools and solidifies. The process is repeated layer by layer

until  the  entire  object  is  built  (Fig.  2).  Finally,  the  model  can  be  taken  out  from  the print bed manually or chemically removing the support structure [2]. FDM technology is widely used due to its affordability and ease of use.

The COVID-19 pandemic has likely led to disruptions in supply chains, changes in  consumer  behavior  and  demand,  and  shifts  in  priorities  for  many  companies  and governments.  During  the pandemic,  the 3D printing  community  played  a  significant role  in  addressing  the  shortage  of  critical  medical  equipment,  supplies  and  personal protective  equipment  (PPE).  Below  there  are  some  examples  of  how  3D  printers helped in modern conflict in the field of defense. 3D printing community rapidly responded to the shortage of face shields by producing them in large numbers. In some

regions, there was a shortage of ventilators needed to treat critically ill patients, and 3D printing stepped in to help produce essential parts for the devices. Some 3D printing communities started producing nasal swabs, which are used to test for COVID-19, to help alleviate the shortage of these critical items. To reduce the spread of the virus, hands-free door openers to encourage people to avoid touching commonly used surfaces were produced.

Overall, the 3D printing community demonstrated its versatility and responsiveness  during  the  pandemic  by  providing  solutions  to  the  pressing  problems  faced  by society in these challenging times. Many organizations and projects appeared, such as project  DIAMOnD  (Distributed  Injection  Molded  Additive  Manufacturing  for  Directed  Operations  and  Deployment),  which  is  a  U.S.  based  network  of  over  300 desktop 3D printers. The project aims to utilize the capabilities of desktop 3D printing to create a distributed manufacturing network that can support directed operations and deployments.  The  network  leverages  the  advantages  of  3D  printing,  such  as  speed, versatility, and cost-effectiveness, to provide on demand production of parts and components for military and other critical applications. The project is still ongoing and its specific applications in the context of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine are not publicly available.

In a war situation, the choice of production technology would depend on the specific needs and requirements of the products being manufactured. Factors such as time constraints,  cost,  material  availability,  and  product  durability  would  all  need  to  be taken into consideration.

Both  standard  production  technologies  and  additive  manufacturing  have  their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between the two would depend on the specific needs of the situation [4].

For  example,  traditional  manufacturing  methods  may  be  faster  and  more  costeffective for producing large quantities of a single item, while additive manufacturing might be better suited for producing complex or custom parts quickly and with a lower lead time. On the other hand, traditional manufacturing might be better for producing products with higher durability and long-term reliability, while additive manufacturing might be better for producing products with unique or specialized features. In the end, the choice of technology would depend on a thorough evaluation of the specific needs and requirements of the situation and the products being manufactured.

## 2 Raw Materials

Common materials used  in FDM  3D  printing  include  ABS  (Acrylonitrile  Butadiene Styrene),  PLA  (Polylactic  Acid),  PET  (Polyethylene  Terephthalate),  Nylon.  Tab.  1 illustrates main physical, and thermo-mechanical properties of the used materials.

## 2.1 ABS

ABS is a popular choice for toy and household item manufacturing due to its relatively low harmful effects on humans compared to other polymer materials. However, ABS should not be used for medical implants because its chemical structure contains styrene,  which  lasts  longer  in  the  human  body  [7].  ABS  is  commonly  used  for  testing samples due to its superior resistance to heat, chemicals, and moisture. FDM printing can result in more void regions within the final parts due to the absence of pressure during  the  printing  process.  This  issue  can  be  minimized  by  using  a  smaller  layer thickness,  which  improves  the bond between layers and reduces interlayer distortion

that causes micro voids. To improve the strength of printed ABS parts, process parameters such as infill density, orientation, layer thickness, airgaps, raster angle, and width should be considered. Additionally, nozzle diameter has a significant impact on part strength,  as  increasing  the  nozzle  diameter  enhances  the  strength  between  layers  by reducing voids, resulting in higher tensile strength [8].

## 2.2 Nylon

In comparison to ABS and PLA, Nylon demonstrates superior chemical resistance, as well as higher tensile strength and Young s modulus. FDM printed Nylon parts posʼ sess  high  tensile  and  impact  strength,  good  resilience,  and  low  creep,  making  them advantageous [5]. Moreover, Nylon achieves better mechanical properties at elevated temperatures,  as  the  bonds  between  layers  become  much  stronger  when  exposed  to higher  temperatures.  However,  Nylon  is  a  hydrophilic  material,  and  its  mechanical properties  are  negatively  affected  by  moisture  absorbency.  Unfortunately,  studies exploring  the  mechanical  properties  and  effects  of  various  parameters  on  Nylon  are limited  compared  to  ABS  and  PLA  [9].  As  with  ABS  and  PLA,  reducing  the  layer thickness of printed parts enhances the tensile strength, as the bond between layers is stronger. The mostly used Nylon material in the 3D printing industry is Polyamide 12 (PA  12).  Nylon s  crystallinity  is  the  primary  reason  for  achieving  better  functional ʼ properties such as printed part shrinkage, chemical, wear, and thermal resistance. As a result  of  these  benefits,  nylon  is  widely  employed  in  the  manufacturing  of  home appliances and white goods, as well as in aerospace and automotive engineering applications [10].

## 2.3 PLA

When comparing ABS with PLA, it is apparent that ABS has better impact strength while PLA has higher tensile strength. PLA is capable of degrading under proper conditions,  while  other polymers are typically disposed of or recycled [5]. Furthermore, parts made from PLA retain their plasticity and toughness for extended periods. Similar to ABS FDM, many studies have been conducted to identify the optimal conditions to achieve better mechanical properties for PLA. It has been found that tensile strength is  primarily  influenced  by  the  raster  angle,  followed  by  the  raster  width  and  layer height. Increasing  the  layer height of  the  print  typically  produces  many  voids  in  the microstructure, which decreases the tensile strength of the printed part. When the raster angle is set to 0°, the tensile load is mostly supported by the PLA filament aligned

in the longitudinal direction, whereas at 90°, the load is carried by the bond between layers. As a result, failure occurs due to delamination and fracture of the layers in 90° rasters, while in the 0° orientation, failure is caused by filament fracture [11].

## 2.4 PEEK

Aside  from  the  aforementioned  polymers,  the  3D  printing  industry  also  utilizes a group  of  high  performance  or  engineering  polymers.  PEEK,  which  falls  under  the PAEK  (polyaryletherketone)  category,  is  a  widely  used  colorless,  semicrystalline, organic  thermoplastic  polymer  in  the  engineering  field  for  creating  excellent  quality aircraft,  rocket,  racing  car,  and  drone  parts.  Despite  its  remarkable  properties,  only a few experiments have been conducted to determine the effects of print orientation, nozzle diameter, printing speed, extrusion speed, nozzle temperature, and infill density on the mechanical properties of PEEK [12]. Due to the inherent qualities of PEEK, it has found a prominent role in medical applications requiring better reliability such as bone  tissue  engineering,  orthopedic  implants,  joint  replacements,  spinal  implants, prosthesis systems, and dentistry [13].

## 3 Composite Materials

A composite material is formed by combining different materials to create a material with superior functional properties. The main objective of developing composite materials  in  the  3D  printing  industry  is  to  obtain  better  mechanical  properties  and  other functional characteristics such as optical, thermal, and electrical properties that cannot be achieved by pure polymers [14]. In a composite, one or more materials act as the reinforcing component, while another material serves as the binding or matrix material.  FDM  printed  composites  can  use  various  reinforcing  materials  to  achieve  the required functional property, or a combination of properties from the same composite. Depending on the specific needs, particles, fibers, or nanomaterials can be added to the polymer to print a polymer matrix composite (PMC). The mostly used PMCs are micro  or  nanoparticle  reinforced  composites,  metal  particle  reinforced  composites,  and short or continuous fiber reinforced composites. By incorporating metal particles such as  iron,  copper,  stainless  steel,  or  titanium,  or  nanoparticles  like  carbon  nanotubes, graphene  or  graphite  into  the  polymer,  a  high-performance  composite  material  with embedded thermal, electrical, optical, and excellent mechanical properties can be produced. Glass fibers are the mostly used fibers in reinforcing polymers due to their cost effectiveness. They find wide applications in various industries such as defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors. Appropriate alignment of continuous glass fibers offers steel-like  properties  with  a  specific  weight  that  is  almost  75 %  less  than  aluminum. Unlike carbon fibers, glass fibers are not inherently strong and can be easily damaged when used separately. However, when used with thermoplastics or thermoset materials, they complement each other and provide excellent mechanical properties [15].

Stephanie Kwolek invented a synthetic fiber called aramid fiber with exceptional tensile  strength  to  weight  ratio  and  heat  resistance  in  1965.  This  fiber  is  commonly known as DuPont Kevlar, and its tensile  properties  are primarily  in  the  longitudinal direction, which requires careful fiber orientation management in products or composites. When executed correctly, its tensile strength to weight ratio is five times better than  steel.  While  it  was  initially  used  in  the  military  and  aerospace  fields,  it  is  now applied  in  various  products  and  is  available  on  the  consumer  market.  The  price  of aramid fibers varies depending on the diameter of a single thread. The price is relative-

ly high for discontinuous fibers, and it increases for continuous variants, where fibers are twisted, and the turn per inch influences the physical characteristics and price. To make aramid fibers compatible with the matrix for usage in FDM, they are coated with a bonding agent.

The use of FDM printed composites has become widespread in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, marine, sports equipment, electrical, and medical industries.  Prominent  agencies  in  the  aerospace  industry  such  as  NASA  employ  FDM for manufacturing tools, functional prototypes, concept models, and lightweight parts. In the automotive industry, FDM is mainly utilized for printing jigs, fixtures, and prototypes  for  testing  purposes.  While  the  biocompatibility  of  FDM  printed  composite parts is still under investigation in the medical industry, experiments have been carried out  to  incorporate  these  composites  in  the  production  of  orthopedic  and  dental  implants.  The  mostly  used  reinforcement  material  in  PMC  is  short  or  continuous  fiber reinforcements,  which  offer  a  high  strength  to  weight  ratio,  rigidity,  and  corrosion resistance [16].

## 3.1 Short Fibers

For many years, polymers have gained popularity due to their lightweight and ease of processing,  but  their  material  strength  is  lower  compared  to  steel  and  aluminium, which  are  their  competitors.  A  summary  of  fiber  properties  can  be  found  in  [17]. However,  polymer  fiber  composites  have  shown  outstanding  behavior  in  enhancing mechanical properties and providing solutions to many of today s problems. ʼ

By introducing discontinuous (chopped) fibers and later continuous fibers to polymers,  anisotropic  material  behavior  can  be  achieved,  and  even  stronger  anisotropic behavior can be attained when combined with FDM technology. Several developments have been made to reinforce polymers in research institutes and industrial researches. The main types of fibers used to reinforce polymers are Carbon, Glass, and Aramid. Carbon fibers consist of filaments made of at least 92 % carbon, typically in a nongraphitic  state,  which  are  combined  into  tows  of  several  thousands  of  strings  with a diameter  of  5-8  micrometers,  measured  in  K  number,  such  as  1K,  1.5K,  and  2K. Carbon  fibers  have  gained  popularity  in  various  industries  due  to  their  impressive mechanical properties, including high tensile strength and low thermal expansion. In fact, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites offer similar features to steel but are much lighter, making them an attractive choice for applications in aviation, automotive, and marine industries.

## 3.2 Continuous Fibers

Continuous  fiber  reinforcement  has  become  a  recent  possibility  in  FDM,  expanding the range of applications for rapid prototyping. Polymers can be reinforced with fibers in  various  ways,  including  the  discontinuous/dual  (see  Fig.  3A)  and  continuous  (see Fig. 3B) placement of fibers. The mechanical properties of printed parts with discontinuous fiber reinforcement are significantly influenced by the fiber length. Conversely,  parts  reinforced  with  a  bulk  of  continuous  fibers  typically  exhibit  more significant improvements than their discontinuous equivalents [18]. With co-extrusion, a thermoplastic resin filament and a fiber filament are supplied separately to the FDM printer head. The thermoplastic filament is melted inside a heated nozzle, and as the reinforcing fiber passes through the nozzle, it gets impregnated by the resin. The extruded filament is then deposited onto the printing platform, attaches to the previous

layer, and solidifies. In the dual extrusion approach, the reinforcing fiber filament and the thermoplastic resin filament are extruded separately through two nozzles onto the printing plate.

The  mechanical  properties  of  printed  parts  with  discontinuous  fiber  reinforcement are significantly influenced by the fiber length. Conversely, parts reinforced with a bulk of continuous fibers typically exhibit more significant improvements than their discontinuous counterparts [19].

## 4 3D Prints in the Modern Conflict

However, the use of 3D printing technology in military and defense applications has been growing in recent years. Starting from design and production of functional prototypes using FDM technology for use in military equipment and systems, 3D printing is able  to  create  composite  materials  with  improved  mechanical  properties  for  use  in military applications, such as protective armor and structural components [20].

Additionally,  3D  printing  can  allow  for  the  producing  complex,  custom  made parts and components that may be difficult to produce using traditional manufacturing methods.  Some  specific  examples  of  the  use  of  3D  printing  in  military  and  defense applications include the production of prosthetics for wounded soldiers, the manufacture  of  customized  weapon  components, and the development of prototypes for new military technologies.

## 4.1 Customized Weapon Components

The company PJSC Mayak has developed a conversion kit that can be 3D-printed for the former Soviet Union RKG-3 grenade. This kit involves the removal of the handle and parachute of the grenade, and instead, fitting it with a tail cone and stabilizing fins that can be printed using a 3D printer (Fig. 4).

The 3D printed tail fins on the RKG 1600 have drastically improved its accuracy, allowing drones to drop them into a one-meter circle from 300 m up [21]. This makes hitting  a  tank  much  easier  than  before  when  using  the  inaccurate  RKG-3,  which  required a dangerously close proximity to the target.

RKG 1600 serves as a prime example of how 3D printing technology can rejuvenate old materials.  It  also  highlights  the  adaptability  and  responsiveness  of  this  new form of manufacturing. Ukraine army simply distributed the print files to companies or

volunteers with 3D printers. The conversion kit can even be printed on an affordable Ender 3 printer.

Ukrainian forces have been utilizing various commercial drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, and have recently begun equipping them with converted grenades, now known as the RKG 1600.

Armed military drones are typically expensive, such as the MQ-9 Reaper which costs roughly $32 million and can carry a 1.7 ton of weapons [22] In contrast, an offthe-shelf  octocopter  capable  of  lifting  2.5  kg  costs  less  than  $2,500  and  can  carry a pair of RKG 1600 mini bombs. On popular 3D printing community sites, there are ready STL parts of different drone types (Fig. 5) that are used in Ukrainian conflict.

3D  Tech  Additive  is  a  company  that  designs  and  manufactures  a  variety  of equipment enhancements for weapons, such as holsters for AK-47s to enable soldiers to secure their firearms, bullet magazines to repurpose spent cartridges, grenade bags for transport, and antiglare lenses for sniper scopes, the latest addition to their product line. The antireflective lenses reduce the likelihood of Ukrainian snipers being spotted by the enemy.

## 4.2 Medical Resources

3D printing can also be used in the defense industry to produce prosthetics, orthopedic devices, and other medical equipment that are required for soldiers and other military personnel. In 2010, during the devastating earthquake in Haiti, medical devices were printed quickly, allowing doctors to provide health care without waiting for equipment to ship from abroad. In 2018, an organization called the Glia Project came to the aid of Palestinian civilians injured in the Gaza Strip while protesting against Israel, creating and shipping them a 3D printed 'Gaza tourniquet'.

The intensity of the conflict in Ukraine resulted in numerous casualties and a depletion  of  essential  medical  resources.  Members  of  the  3D  printing  community engaged  in  discussions  with  Ukrainian  military  authorities,  hospital  managers,  and charitable groups to determine the most beneficial items they could produce rapidly. The mostly requested items were bandages and tourniquets (Fig. 6).

Although the majority of 3D printers produce items that help prevent fatalities or alleviate the harsh conditions of warfare, some are concentrating on the rehabilitation of  soldiers.  Brett  Carey,  a  physical  therapist  based  in  Hawaii,  creates  3D  printed splints (Fig. 7B) that can be sent to combatants. Hand fractures are prevalent in combat, and when they are not treated correctly, they can result in long term problems. If the  injuries  are  severe,  Carey  has  people  use  EM3D,  a  3D  imaging  application,  to submit images of their injuries. This allows him to create a personalized splint that can be shipped to Ukraine.

## 5 SWOT Analysis

In this part, the author uses SWOT analysis which is a strategic planning tool that is used  to  identify  and  analyze  the  Strengths,  Weaknesses,  Opportunities,  and  Threats (SWOT) of an organization or project. The objective of a SWOT analysis is to help organizations  or  projects  to  understand  their  internal  and  external  environment,  to identify  their  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  to  identify  potential  opportunities  and threats. This information can then be used to develop a strategic plan to achieve their goals and objectives. The SWOT analysis can be applied to a wide range of organizations  and  projects,  including  businesses,  non-profit  organizations,  and  government agencies [27].

To  conduct  this  SWOT  analysis,  a  group  of  50  university  technology  students with a background or interest in FDM technology was chosen to contribute. Participants were provided with relevant materials and resources about FDM technology and its potential in military applications in advance.

Introduction  and  Context  Setting:  The  brainstorming  session  was  conducted  in a structured  manner.  Firstly,  an  overview  of  FDM  technology  and  its  relevance  in military  applications  was  provided.  The  purpose  of  the  SWOT  analysis  and  the  importance  of  their  insights  were  explained.  For  idea  generation  participants  were encouraged  to  share  their  thoughts  on  the  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and threats associated with FDM technology in the military sector. Facilitators encouraged open and free discussion, ensuring that all participants had the chance to contribute. Ideas were categorized into the four SWOT components.

Facilitators and participants engaged in a discussion to evaluate and elaborate on the generated ideas. Similar ideas were consolidated, and unique insights were highlighted.  Participants  were  given  the  opportunity  to  prioritize  the  most  critical  and relevant SWOT elements using a voting system. The elements with the highest votes were identified as the most significant.

The analysis was later compiled into a report whose components and their elements are presented in the Tab. 2.

## 5.1 Strengths

3D  printing  technology  offers  quick  and  efficient  production  of  complex  parts  and prototypes,  reducing  production  times  and  costs.  Moreover,  flexibility  to  produce a wide range of parts and components in a short amount of time, enables rapid prototyping and production of essential components for defense operations.

3D printing also offers the potential for decentralized production, making it possible for defense forces to produce parts and components in the field without relying on supply chains. Printers can be put into the container with the electricity aggregator and go close to the front lines to create the most needed parts.

## 5.2 Weaknesses

FDM is  still  in  its  early  stages  of  development,  and  many  challenges  remain  to  be addressed,  such  as  material  quality,  precision,  and  consistency.  The  technology  also faces competition from traditional manufacturing methods, which may be more established and cost effective in many cases. 3D printing may also pose a security risk if the technology is used to produce counterfeit or malicious parts.

## 5.3 Opportunities

On  the  other  hand,  3D  printing  technology  offers  the  potential  to  revolutionize  the defense industry by enabling new ways of producing parts and components. It can be used to support a wide range of defense operations, including disaster relief, special operations,  and  peacekeeping  missions.  There  are  new  opportunities  for  innovation and collaboration between the defense and commercial sectors.

## 5.4 Threats

The technology may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could result in the production of faulty or malicious parts. The potential for large scale production of counterfeit parts may pose a threat to the defense industry, and it is important to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and ethically. 3D printing with plastic materials can be used to produce prototypes and small batches of items such as magazines, shields, and accessories,  but  it  is  not  recommended  for  producing  items  that  are  exposed  to  high temperatures and loads.

Unfortunately, this availability of 3D printing technology has also enabled some users to produce firearms without control and oversight. As a result, many countries have taken steps to limit the illegal production of firearms using 3D printing and increase citizen safety. In many countries, it is illegal to print firearms, and penalties for doing so can be severe.

The widespread use of 3D printing technology in the defense industry may also lead to job losses as traditional manufacturing methods become less necessary.

The SWOT analysis underscores the potential of FDM technology in war conflicts,  emphasizing  its  accessibility,  versatility,  and  citizen  engagement  as  strengths. Nevertheless, the analysis also underscores the need for quality control and standardization to address weaknesses. FDM technology presents an opportunity for civilians to actively participate in defense projects, spurring technological advancements. However, resistance  from  traditional  defines  stakeholders,  competition  from  alternative technologies, and limited government support are tangible threats. To maximize FDM technology s potential, mitigating weaknesses and addressing threats is imperative. ʼ

## 6 Pairwise Comparison

Pairwise comparison is a method used to compare and evaluate the relative importance or priority of multiple options, items, or criteria. In this method, each option is compared to every other option in a systematic manner and the results are used to rank the options  based  on  their  relative  strengths  and  weaknesses.  Pairwise  comparison  is commonly used in decision making processes, such as product selection, prioritization of  tasks,  and  project  management. The  method  helps  to make objective, data driven decisions by taking into account multiple factors and reducing subjectivity [28].

The basic equation for pairwise comparison in a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can be represented using the following formula

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Aij - represents the score or ratio of the preference of option   over option  , i j Pi -is the performance or value of option  , i Pj - is the performance or value of option  . j

This equation is used to express the relative preference of one option over another based on their performance or value for a specific criterion. The value of Aij can be interpreted as how many times option   is preferred over option  . If i j Aij is greater than 1, it implies that option   is preferred over option  . If it is less than 1, it implies that i j option   is preferred over option  . j i

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Weighted Score for an Option is the overall score for the option being evaluated, Wi - represents the weight assigned to the  -th criterion, the weights represent the relai tive importance or priority of each criterion, Ci - represents the performance, value, or rating of the option with respect to the  -th criterion, i n is  the  total number of criteria being considered in the decision-making process.

This formula allows you to compute a weighted score by multiplying each criterion s  weight  by  the  option's  performance  with  respect  to  that  criterion  and  then ʼ summing up the results. The resulting weighted score provides a quantitative measure

of how well the option meets the specified criteria while taking into account the importance of each criterion in the decision-making process.

There are several options that can be used for making a pairwise comparison between  additive  manufacturing  (3D  printing)  and  traditional  production  technologies. Here are some of the common criteria that are used:

- · speed  of  production  -  how  quickly  can  the  products  be  manufactured  using each technology,
- · design flexibility - how much freedom is there in terms of design options and customization,
- · cost-effectiveness - the cost of producing the products using each technology,
- · materials options - the variety of materials available for use in each technology,
- · surface finish quality - the level of surface finish quality that can be achieved,
- · precision and accuracy - how precise and accurate the final product is,
- · scalability - how easy is it to scale up or down production as needed,
- · waste generation - how much waste is generated during the production process,
- · energy efficiency - how energy-efficient is each technology,
- · environmental impact - the impact on the environment from each technology.

These are just some of the options that can be used to make a pairwise comparison  between  additive  manufacturing  and  traditional  production  technologies.  The specific criteria selected will depend on the context and the goals of the comparison.

To compare the injection molding process and FDM technology for defense applications during a war, we will use example criteria: Speed of Production (SP), CostEffectiveness  (CE),  Design  Flexibility  (DF),  Materials  Options  (MO),  and  Precision and Accuracy (PA). The next step is to assign scores to each technology for each criterion on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent (Tab. 3).

Now,  we  assign  weights  to  each  criterion  based  on  their  relative  importance, based  on  the  priorities  of  defense  applications  during  a  war.  For  example,  for  low volume  production:  SP  (W\_SP)  =  0.3,  CE  (W\_CE)  =  0.2,  DF  (W\_DF)  =  0.2,  MO (W\_MO) = 0.1, PA (W\_PA) = 0.2

Weighted Score for molding process = (W\_SP * SP\_Mol) + (W\_CE * CE\_Mol) + (W\_DF * DF\_Mol) + (W\_MO * MO\_Mol) + (W\_PA * PA\_Mol) = 2.8

Weighted  Score  for  FDM  Technology  =  (W\_SP  *  SP\_FDM)  +  (W\_CE  * CE\_FDM) + (W\_DF * DF\_FDM) + (W\_MO * MO\_FDM) + (W\_PA * PA\_FDM) = 3.5

| Weight             | 0.3                                               | 0.2                                                         | 0.2                               | 0.1                                                              | 0.2                                   |

Based on the weighted scores, the molding process has a score of 2.8, and FDM Technology  has  a  score  of  3.5.  For  low  volume  production  weight  score  3.5  to  2.8

points FDM to be preferable technology. Injection molding is suitable for large scale production of consistent and uniform parts, because it has an ability to produce high volumes of parts  at  a  lower  cost  per  unit  compared  to  FDM  printing.  Parts  are  produced with high precision and accuracy.

FDM Printing  main  domain  is  quick  production  of  spare  parts  or  replacement parts for equipment on the battlefield. Another advantage is the ability to rapidly produce custom or complex  parts that may  not be available through traditional manufacturing methods. Lead time compared to traditional manufacturing methods is reduced especially when we use already prepared STL files. In both technologies, it is important to consider the availability of raw materials, the quality of the finished parts, and the speed of production when choosing a manufacturing method for defense applications during war.

## 7 Conclusion

In  conclusion,  FDM  is  a  popular  and  accessible  3D  printing  technology  that  uses a variety of materials to produce objects with a wide range of properties. The mostly used  material  for  FDM  is  PLA  due  to  its  ease  of  use,  low  cost,  and  environmental friendliness.  However,  other  materials  such  as  ABS,  PETG,  and  nylon  are  also  frequently used in FDM printing, each with their own unique characteristics.

While PLA is the most widely used material for FDM printing, its low melting point and brittleness can be limiting factors in certain applications. ABS, on the other hand, is known for its strength and durability, but it requires a higher printing temperature and can produce toxic fumes during printing. PETG offers a balance of strength, flexibility, and ease of use, while nylon is a highly versatile material that is often used in industrial applications.

Overall,  the  choice  of  material  for  FDM  printing  depends  on  the  specific  requirements  of  the  project,  such  as  strength,  flexibility,  or  surface  finish,  as  well  as considerations such as cost, environmental impact, and ease of use. By understanding the properties of different materials and selecting the most appropriate one for the job, FDM printing can be a highly effective and versatile tool for producing high quality objects for a wide range of applications.

3D printing technology has revolutionized many industries, and the military and defense sector is no exception. The ability to create complex and customized parts and components using 3D printing has opened up new possibilities in the design and production of military equipment and systems. From prosthetics for wounded soldiers to customized  weapon  components,  3D  printing  has  proven  to  be  a  versatile  and  costeffective solution for many military applications.

Based  on  the  pairwise  weighted  scores,  for  small  production  volumes  during a military  conflict,  FDM  Technology  has  a  score  of  3.5,  and  the  injection  molding process  has  a  score  of  2.8.  Therefore,  FDM  Technology  is  the  better  choice  when considering the specified low volume production criteria and weights for this scenario.
