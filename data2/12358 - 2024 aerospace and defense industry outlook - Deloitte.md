1. Talent: A&D companies are addressing workforce challenges amid rising demand and changing workforce expectations

The A&D industry is facing a new talent landscape that is mainly driven by increasing salary levels, increased employee mobility, a reevaluation of employee relationships with the workplace, and an intensely competitive job market. Evolving employee expectations, which have only amplified since the pandemic, have often made it challenging for A&D companies to attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce. These workforce issues could prove to be a significant pain point for A&D companies as they begin to scale production operations to meet growing demand across the industry.

Attracting talent

The US A&D industry has surpassed prepandemic levels in terms of employment. In 2022, US-based A&D companies increased their workforce by 101,700 to 2.2 million, marking a 4.87% increase from 2021 and surpassing prepandemic 2019 levels of 2.18 million.3

Despite the rise in workforce numbers, A&D companies are likely to face talent shortages. These shortages may hamper production demands resulting from domestic travel increases and nations increasing their armament stockpiles. Currently, the industry is struggling to attract talent, ranging from technicians and manufacturers to engineers. One leading Asia-based engineering company noted that the shortage of technicians may lead to increased maintenance costs and impact fleet expansion forecasts.4 Furthermore, in the National Association of Manufacturers’ (NAM’s) 2023 third quarter manufacturers’ outlook survey, about three out of four surveyed US manufacturers stated that attracting and retaining a quality workforce is their primary business challenge.5

The manufacturing industry, including A&D manufacturing, is increasingly competing with other industries for skilled talent.6 A&D companies recognize this, as top talent with digital skills can be drawn to digital jobs within a multitude of areas, including automotive (for example, the battery electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle segments) and life sciences (for example, medical technology, and biotechnology).

A&D companies may need to expand their strategies beyond compensation to accommodate the changing needs of the workforce. The US A&D industry has an annual average salary of US$108,900 which is approximately 55% above the national average.7 That said, many Gen Z employees are keen to have careers with broad impact and a purpose.8 These companies may attract talent with mission-focused marketing campaigns and undertake more strategic recruitment to ensure that the values of the employees and the company align.

Retaining talent

Despite a significant number of new hires, job openings in the manufacturing industry were still 604,000 in August 2023.9 Additionally, quits accounted for about 68% of total separations. To compete in a tightening labor market, A&D companies will likely address both talent attraction and, potentially more significantly, talent retention issues. The A&D industry has high requirements and expectations for its employees, including specific educational criteria and security clearances. This could necessitate a focus on retaining talent, especially with the increasing number of retirees.

Historically, these companies have succeeded with a workforce that possesses deep experience and a strong connection to the company culture. Therefore, given the competitive state of the job market, it is important for the industry to retain highly qualified workers.

A&D companies are using compensation and flexible work arrangements to enhance retention and turn the tide of employee attrition. This approach has been adopted by the manufacturing segment of the A&D industry where, according to Deloitte’s 2024 manufacturing industry outlook, there was a rise of 4% in the average hourly earnings of employees between the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the manufacturing industry has undergone a significant shift toward remote work over the last two years, during which there has been a 19% reduction in the average number of quits.10

The retention levels of A&D companies could plateau at a certain point if they continue to only offer flexibility benefits. According to the NAM’s 2023 second quarter manufacturers’ outlook survey, inflexible production, shift needs, and the creation of differences between workforce populations are some major challenges manufacturers face when offering such flexibility to workers.11 The industry will likely explore new avenues to both attract and retain talent.

Pursuing and implementing emerging technology can help not only address profit margins, but also invigorate a workforce. Regardless of an employee’s job description, A&D companies may begin to consider initiating new programs that allow employees to engage with advanced technologies, which may include tech-based rotational programs or designated time to pursue passion projects within the company.

Developing talent

With an increasing number of retirements and an aging workforce (about 26% of the A&D workforce is over the age of 55),12 the industry should train younger professionals for long-term sustainable operations and security. A&D companies can upskill their workforce by developing more learning avenues in alignment with the technological evolution within the industry. These avenues may include:

Working closely with colleges to create novel training and workforce development programs;

Expanding internships, apprenticeships, and other career development initiatives; and

Furthering cooperative research agreements with tier one research universities.

Employees in the A&D sector, across all career levels, should be educated on the importance of cybersecurity and should possess a clear understanding of their specific responsibilities in upholding a secure environment.13 And in line with that, A&D companies’ workforce development strategies will not only attract and retain talent but can also help ensure a secure environment for them.
