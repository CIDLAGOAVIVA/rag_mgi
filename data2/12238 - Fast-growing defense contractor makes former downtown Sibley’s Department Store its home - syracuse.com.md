Syracuse, N.Y. -- A former downtown Syracuse department store is the new home of a defense contractor making the sophisticated electronics that help control missile launches from U.S. Navy ships.

Just across the street from the Landmark Theatre and on the same block as Salt City Market, HII is employing 100 people working on military contracts.
