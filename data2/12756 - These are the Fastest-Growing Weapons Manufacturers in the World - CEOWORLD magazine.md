In 2022, global military spending hit a historic high of $2.24 trillion, marking a 3.7% increase. The past decade has witnessed a remarkable 20% growth in spending on military hardware, weapons, armies, and technical operations. The primary driver behind last year’s surge was the intensification of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leading to substantial spending hikes in European NATO nations and significant weapons donations to the embattled country.

The conflict in Ukraine has particularly benefited weapons manufacturers, with the United States hosting twelve of the world’s top 25 rapidly expanding arms-producing and military services companies. To identify these Fastest-Growing Weapons Manufacturers in the World, CEOWORLD magazine analyzed data from the “The SIPRI Top 100 Arms-producing and Military Services Companies” report, along with earlier publications from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
