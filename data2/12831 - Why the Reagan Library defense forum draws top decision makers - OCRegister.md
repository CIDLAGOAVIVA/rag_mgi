High in the remote rolling hills of Simi Valley, the who’s who of the defense landscape meets annually to discuss the challenges and solutions of maintaining the United States’ “peace through strength” amid global threats.

Over the weekend, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library marked its 10th year hosting the Reagan National Defense Forum, an event where the highest tier of the Department of Defense leadership rubbed shoulders with lawmakers, the Joint Chiefs, representatives of defense and technology companies and foreign defense leaders.

Experts call the Southern California-based RNDF one of the most important forums globally because leaders who can make a difference come together and discuss key challenges to national defense away from the noise of the Washington, D.C. beltway and in a region with a rich history of aerospace and defense innovation that remains at the forefront of the innovation economy.

“It’s immersive,” said Dave Trulio, CEO and president of the Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, who previously worked in the defense industry and in presidential administrations. “When they’re here, they’re present. There are fewer distractions than there would be in a busy city center. It’s healthy to get out of the beltway and go deep.”

This year’s forum included a day of back-to-back panel discussions with company executives, lawmakers and DOD leadership. The top theme was artificial intelligence and how being ahead of the curve is critical to national defense. Other topics included protecting the hemisphere and homeland, supplying allies, boosting recruitment and technological competition in national defense.

Trulio said the forum has seen a lot of evolution in its first decade. In 2013, discussions focused on the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, ISIS and the Syrian civil war, he said. They mainly included lawmakers and policy influencers along with traditional defense contractors such as Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Co. and Northrup Grumman Corporation.

“We’re in a very different place now,” Trulio said, adding China was not the focus then. “One of the things that I think is a favorable evolution is taking a more holistic look at what leads to strong national defense and strong national security.”

As an example, he said this year’s forum not only included U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who gave a wide-ranging keynote speech on Saturday in which he also addressed AI and the importance of the nation’s industrial base, but also U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo attended for the first time.

“That’s not typical for an event that’s on the other side of the country,” Trulio said. “They’re here because they truly recognize it’s worth their time.”

Having Raimondo attend also played to another aspect of the forum, which focused on the importance of economics and defense.

“Commerce has a significant role to play in the national security enterprise,” Trulio said, adding economic industry and commercial technology are significant in the country’s national security approach. As a result, he said, the forum has become a hot spot for non-traditional companies to get a share of the spotlight.

This year’s main sponsor, Palantir Technologies, is a company specializing in machine-assisted and human-driven data analysis, he pointed out and would not have attended the RNDF a decade ago.

“On the panels, there are names you recognize and some you won’t,” he said. “That’s reflective that there are a lot of emerging companies that are entrepreneurial and not traditionally associated with defense. That’s important from the innovative standpoint.”

And, unlike other defense forums, Trulio said the RNDF has a common purpose of advancing “peace through strength,” a nod to President Ronald Reagan’s legacy. Panel topics were discussed with that theme in mind.

Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain, who is now affiliated with the Sagamore Institute in Indiana, has attended six of the 10 years the RNDF has been held and said he ranks the forum on a par with the Munich Security Forum and the Halifax International Security Forum.

“It’s very clear this is a standout conference,” he said. “(The RNDF) takes on a very different approach. Where the other two are very much international in their flavor, this one ranks with them because of the topics being discussed. The other reason it ranks is because of who attends,” he said, adding, “You can have a serious conference with great ideas, but if you don’t have influencers, people who can actually take action,” it won’t have the impact.

Hendrix said it’s the mix of decision makers that attend that helps draw those in private industry, including entrepreneurs in innovation and defense.

“Industry wants to have its day to have conversations with these people,” he said. “As important as the panels are, the sidebar conversations, what’s discussed in the hallways or afterward, give a chance for the one-on-one conversations. Those in engineering and industry can talk about what’s next.”

Among those who took advantage of meeting attendees with influence was John Brennan, who served in the Army and the intelligence community and is now the general manager of the public sector division of Scale AI, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

“What’s unique about this is tying it back to the presidential library and research center and connecting with President Reagan and what he represented in winning the Cold War,” Brennan said. “And doing it by upholding human rights and freedom and standing up to adversaries and doing it through technology through the Star Wars program and the stealth fighter and just having a strong economy.”

Brandon Tseng, a former Navy SEAL who co-founded Shield AI with his brother, Ryan Tseng, was attending for the first time. The San Diego-based company aims to protect service members and civilians with AI systems.

“In the defense industry, you see these big trade shows and you get senior leadership from the service to come and the program managers,” he said. “At Reagan, it’s special in the sense that you get everybody in the same room, who are all senior leaders, to focus on solving problems. You have Republicans and Democrats and everybody is saying national security is important and that’s what we’re here to talk about. When they talk about the future of defense, a lot has to do with technology.”

Brandon Tseng, who combines a mechanical engineering background with his SEAL experiences, is helping to create self-driving technology for aviation. The company has more than 650 people on staff and its tech has been part of 17 deployments with the Navy and Marine Corps.

“What Tesla and Google’s Waymo does for self-driving cars, we’re doing for self-driving aircraft,” he said. “The reason that’s important for the military is that it enables aircraft to operate without GPS, without communications” because other countries have jamming capabilities.

“You see the consequences of that when you see reports that Ukraine is losing 10,000 drones per month,” Tseng said. “When you have Russia, China, Iran being able to take away our conventional deterrence, we are no longer able to deter our adversaries.

“Shield AI is focused on reestablishing that air superiority with AI pilots,” he said.

Being on top of deterrence is what Gen. Christopher Mahoney, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, talked about during a panel on the U.S. being ahead of China in national defense.

“If you believe you’re winning a race, but the runner behind you is catching you, that would tell you that you need to increase the pace,” Mahoney said. “If you’re losing, you need to change the pace. In either case, we have to be remarkably self-critical about how fast we’re moving in all domains and in all areas of technology in order to provide that deterrence capability.”

Mahoney, who is presently acting commandant while Gen. Eric Smith, who earlier this year was appointed commandant but is recovering from a heart attack, was previously the commanding general for the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.

He, too, found it important to be at the forum, he said.

“The forum is an opportunity to connect with industry and other national security-minded partners on the West Coast that we don’t see every day in Washington,” he said. “Some of the smartest people on the planet are here at the Reagan forum.”

“Every conversation, whether it’s with industry, members of Congress, or my peers in uniform,” he said, “is about how to improve integration, how to better the joint force, and how to best incorporate global allies and partners.”
