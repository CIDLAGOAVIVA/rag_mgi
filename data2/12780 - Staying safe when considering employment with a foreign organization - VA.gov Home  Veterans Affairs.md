The U.S. Department of Defense is warning Veterans and service members that foreign governments and companies are targeting and recruiting U.S. and NATO trained military talent across specialties and career fields to train foreign militaries, foreign defense industries, or foreign government agencies to fill gaps in their military capabilities. By essentially training the trainer, many of those who accept contracts with these foreign companies are eroding our national security, putting the very safety of their fellow service members and our country at risk, potentially violating U.S. law.

Often, foreign government involvement is not communicated outright, highlighting the need for general caution when considering employment with foreign organizations. Protecting our national defense information is the responsibility of each service member and Veteran.

If you or someone you know is being targeted for recruitment or was recruited to train foreign militaries, foreign defense industry, or foreign government agencies about the skills and capabilities you learned in the U.S. military, please report it to:
