Mick Jaggers, a 13-year Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) veteran, has been appointed chief operating officer at Epirus, a Torrance, California-based directed energy system manufacturer.

Before joining Epirus in May, Jaggers was VP of program management at defense and space contractor CAES.

Jaggers also held various roles of increasing responsibility at Northrop, including VP of the Advanced Technology Development Center and VP and program manager of the company’s Global Hawk remotely-piloted aircraft program.

He started his career at Northrop in July 2008 as director of special programs.

Jaggers served in the U.S. Air Force for 20 years and was assigned as the F-15E division commander for operational test and evaluation at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.
