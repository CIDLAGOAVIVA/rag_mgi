As part of his visit to the United States, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky met with executives of US defense companies late on 11 December.

“I had an important and fruitful meeting with leaders of US defense companies. I am grateful to all the workers, engineers, all those who work at American defense companies and partners who produce weapons that help safeguard Ukrainians and help our army defend the country. These are the people who have done a lot for Ukraine,” Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.

Zelenskyy started his official visit to the United States by meeting with US Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Charles Brown at the National Defence University.

Then, the Ukrainian President delivered a speech at the National Defense University of the United States, met with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, then with the President of the World Bank, Ajay Banga.

Zelenskyy also had a meeting with representatives of US think tanks to discuss how to maintain American support for Ukraine and attention to our country in the face of other global challenges.
