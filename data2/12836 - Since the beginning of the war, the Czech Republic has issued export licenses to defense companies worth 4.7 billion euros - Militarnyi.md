Since the beginning of the war, the Czech Republic has issued export licenses to defense companies worth 4.7 billion euros

Since the start of the full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, the Czech Ministry of Defense has issued export licenses worth approximately CZK 117 billion (4.7 billion euros) to defense contractors.

Ceske noviny report about this.

Export licenses were issued to supply weapons for the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The estimated cost of projects already implemented is less than half of this amount, approximately CZK 51.2 billion.

“Of course, it is also a significant boost for our defense industry and for our economy. Again, this will reflect on our economy. We will certainly continue as a ministry not to create any obstacles to the issuance of licenses,” Czech Defense Minister Jana Černohova noted.

According to Jiří Hynek, President of the Defense and Security Industry Association of the Czech Republic, a number of Czech manufacturers supply military products to Ukraine.

“I know from experience that not all licenses will eventually be implemented,” he said.

In 2022, he said, CZK 13 billion worth of military products were exported to Ukraine, 80 percent of which was ammunition, most of which came from company warehouses.

“Personally, I think that this year, the volume of export of military materials to Ukraine will not exceed that in 2022,” Hynek said.

Ms. Černochová shared that since the war began, the Czech Republic had supplied CZK 6.2 billion worth of military equipment to Ukraine, including helicopter gunships, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled howitzers, and rocket launchers.

She added that military depots no longer have more weapons to send to Ukraine.

In November, Militarnyi reported that at the request of the public movement Přísaha, the Czech Ministry of Defense, declassified data on military equipment transferred to Ukraine.
