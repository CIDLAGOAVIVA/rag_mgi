The Welsh government's support for the defence sector in Wales is "opaque" and relies on others to "front it", according to an industry executive.

MPs were told that the Welsh ministers liked "the high paid jobs" it created.

But Russ Wardle, of Arcanum Information Security, said they were not "keen to be associated with the slightly bloody end of the business".

Ministers distanced themselves from support for the industry "by getting Aerospace Wales to front it", he said.

But he told MPs on Westminster's Welsh Affairs Committee that this was "pretty opaque in that the same Welsh government officials stood there on the stand as if it was Welsh government, but the branding's changed."
