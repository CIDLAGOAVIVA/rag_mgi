Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine is ready and will produce more ammunition and military equipment, but it needs support from powerful international companies.

Specifically, this includes the joint production of artillery ammunition, air defense systems, and artillery and missile systems.

In addition, Zelensky discussed the idea of establishing a defense hub in Europe, which would be located in Ukraine.

According to him, to implement this idea, Ukraine is ready to swiftly adopt all necessary decisions, cut red tape, and place orders.

The President of Ukraine noted that Ukraine also intends to invite American partners to take a stake in Ukrainian defense companies, which would be in the interests of all parties involved.
