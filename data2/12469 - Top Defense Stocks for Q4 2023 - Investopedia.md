Top defense stocks make and distribute military equipment, technology, and services. The sector is sensitive to geopolitical tensions, changes in federal military spending, and the advent of military conflicts. Despite underperforming the broader stock market in 2023, the current war between Israel and Hamas, along with a healthy 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, could be a catalyst for purchases in the months ahead. Indeed, the Congress and the Biden administration have budgeted $842 billion for military spending next year, an increase of $26 billion over 2023 levels and $100 billion more than 2022, which doesn't include supplemental bills that could pass increasing military spending for aid to Ukraine and Israel.

Investors can monitor the sector's performance through the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which acts as a proxy exchange-traded fund that holds a portfolio of industry bellwethers like the Boeing Company (BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), and General Dynamics Corporation (GD). The fund has returned 7% over the past year, trailing the broad-based Russell 1000 index by 8.6% over the same period.



Below, we highlight the top defense stocks for the fourth quarter with the best value, the highest growth potential, and the most momentum. All figures are as of Nov. 24, 2023.

Best Value Defense Stocks

The defense stocks displayed in the table below have the lowest 12-month trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This widely used metric assesses a stock's value by comparing its market price with its earnings per share (EPS). It reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. Typically, a high P/E ratio suggests a company may be overvalued, while a low P/E could indicate undervaluation. Investors compare the stock's relative attractiveness to industry peers and the potential for future growth.
