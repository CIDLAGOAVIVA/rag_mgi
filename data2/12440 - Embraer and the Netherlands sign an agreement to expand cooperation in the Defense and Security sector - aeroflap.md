Embraer and Netherlands Industries for Defense & Security (NIDV) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during the 34th NIDV Defense and Security Exhibition (NEDS 2023). The signing of the MoU is a key element in the strategic relationship developed between Embraer and the Netherlands and includes initiatives already underway, associated with the C-390 Millennium and the A-29 Super Tucano.

The Memorandum of Understanding with NIDV adds to Embraer's partnerships and strategic relationships in the country. Furthermore, the agreement establishes a joint framework aimed at exploring future opportunities in line with the priorities of the Dutch Defense Industry Strategy.

These opportunities may include services and the development of new capabilities within Embraer's existing projects, further contributing to the application of defense knowledge, technologies and industrial capabilities in the country. One of the main objectives is to reinforce the participation of Dutch industry in the C-390 supply chain.

“Collaboration with Embraer is important for NIDV and its members. Embraer is a future-oriented manufacturer, with a strong focus on innovation and new ideas to contribute to the operational readiness of its platforms. I am convinced that Embraer adds value to the Dutch Defense Industrial and Technical Base”, says Hans Huigen, Director of NIDV.

“We are pleased to deepen our partnership with NIDV. We are confident that the collaboration strategies of this MoU will bring more value to the Dutch defense and security ecosystem, including research institutes and the business community in different sectors”, says Bosco da Costa Junior, President and CEO of Embraer Defense & Security.

NIDV's contributions deepened Embraer's collaboration with the Netherlands' defense technical and industrial base, which in turn is aligned with the guidelines of the country's Ministry of Economy and Climate Policy. The partnership focuses on developing innovative defense solutions and supporting the C-390 Millennium multi-mission platform. This agreement is in line with several other current Memorandums of Understanding, involving technology and industrial partners such as Fokker Services Group and MultiSIM, and research institutes such as the Royal Dutch Aerospace Center (Royal NLR) and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). .
