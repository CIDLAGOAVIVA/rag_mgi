Rabat – In a year marked by a record defense budget of 124.7 billion dirhams ($12.2 billion), colossal public contracts and accelerated modernization efforts, Morocco’s Royal Armed Forces (FAR) are poised to conclude 2023 with increased readiness in the land, sea, and air domains.

At the forefront of this year’s landmark deals was the acquisition of the American “HIMARS” missile system, surpassing half a billion dollars.

Regarding missile defense systems, the sophisticated Israeli “Pulse” missiles, including the “BARAK-MX,” joined the Chinese “HJ-9A” anti-tank and anti-armor missile system in Morocco’s arsenal this year. Together with the “HIMARS” missiles, they form an impregnable defensive shield.

On the ground front, the US Department of Defense announced Morocco’s reception of an upgraded version of the advanced “TOW” defensive and anti-tank missiles, a pivotal development fortifying the defensive capabilities of Moroccan armored vehicles.

Abderrahman Mkaoui, a security expert, said that 2023 has been “a year of accelerated preparation and development for both offensive and defensive systems of the Royal Armed Forces,” emphasizing the substantial technological advancements as the year’s standout feature.

Morocco also upgraded its air capabilities, with 2023 marking the initiation of manufacturing for the lethal “Apache” helicopters in the country. Moroccan air forces added 24 of these formidable aircrafts to bolster the nation’s surveillance and attack capabilities against potential threats to Moroccan territory.

The new fleet of “F-16 BLOCK 72” Moroccan aircraft is gearing up for advanced electronic warfare and monitoring systems, notably the “ViperShield,” according to revelations by an official from “L3Harris.”

Adding to the array of acquisitions is the latest Israeli suicide drone, “SpyX,” spotted in the Moroccan desert, alongside the Turkish “Akinci,” both making their debut in Morocco in 2023.

The Armed Forces’ emphasis on drones in 2023 displayed not only strength but diversity. Reports disclosed Morocco’s acquisition of the lethal Chinese “Wing Loong 2” drone, diversifying the drone portfolio.

Mohammed Akdizid, another security expert, underscored that “the most significant event in 2023 for the Moroccan Army was the acceleration of military industry workshops in collaboration with international partners.”

Akdizid added that this year has paved the way for strengthening Morocco’s strategic position in weapon modernization through diverse and strategic deals with India, China, Spain, Turkey, and Israel.

Addressing the establishment of military industrial complexes, a report from the Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Islamic Affairs, and Moroccans Residing Abroad Committee unveiled Morocco’s intention to create specialized defense industry zones in the fiscal year 2024.
