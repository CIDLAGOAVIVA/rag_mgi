WASHINGTON — Arcfield, a U.S. defense and intelligence contractor, announced Nov. 29 it has completed the acquisition of Orion Space Solutions, a developer and manufacturer of small satellites and sensor payloads.

The value of the acquisition was not disclosed.

Based in Chantilly, Virginia, Arcfield is a portfolio company of the private equity firm Veritas Capital. It was formed in December 2021 from Peraton’s former systems engineering and support services business.

Orion Space Solutions, based in Louisville, Colorado, was founded in 2005 as Atmospheric & Space Technology Research Associates, and was renamed Orion Space Solutions in 2022.

Space technologies for DoD and IC

“The acquisition of Orion enhances Arcfield’s space exploration and hypersonic detection and tracking capabilities for agencies in the Department of Defense and intelligence community by bringing expertise in sensor and payload design, spacecraft integration and manufacturing, and space mission operations and data analysis,” said Kevin Kelly, chairman and CEO of Arcfield.

“We believe the acquisition of Orion enhances Arcfield’s ability to provide next-generation space technologies in support of DoD and IC missions,” Kelly said.

Orion focuses on atmospheric science, space exploration and research. It designs, integrates and assembles smallsats and cubesats. The company last year won U.S. Space Force contracts for environmental monitoring and in-orbit satellite servicing experiments,

Orion’s founder and CEO Geoff Crowley will remain at Arcfield as chief scientist. Chad Fish was named president and general manager of Orion, which will operate as a business sector under Arcfield.
