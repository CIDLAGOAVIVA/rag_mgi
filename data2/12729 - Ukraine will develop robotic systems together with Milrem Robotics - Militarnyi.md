Ukraine will develop robotic systems together with Milrem Robotics

Milrem Robotics has signed an agreement with the Ukrainian Defense Industry (Ukroboronprom) to start forging next-generation multi-domain robotic defense systems.

The company’s press service reported on this.

The agreement, signed during the First Defense Industries Forum (DFNC1) in Kyiv, details several development and manufacturing activities between Milrem Robotics and the Ukrainian Defense Industry (Ukroboronprom).

As a first step, the parties will start strategic cooperation in identifying Ukraine’s requirements and use cases for robotic systems which can enhance the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian companies involved will integrate Ukraine’s battlefield experience into Milrem Robotics’ existing robotic and autonomous systems and develop new products to create Ukraine’s manned and unmanned multi-domain capabilities.

Ukrainian defense companies will be involved for integration of their defense technology, such as weapon systems, electronic warfare and mine-clearing equipment with Milrem’s robotic vehicles to meet the requirements of the armed forces.

In addition, the parties are considering the manufacturing localization of robotic systems developed by Milrem Robotics in Ukraine.

It regards systems based on the THeMIS multipurpose vehicle, including THeMIS Combat with HMG and antitank capabilities, Combat Engineering adapted for mine detection and demining, as well as unmanned ground vehicles and their modified versions CASEVAC for evacuation of the wounded.

The THeMIS multipurpose vehicle can be used as a cargo delivery vehicle or as an auxiliary vehicle for the transportation of heavy weapons, such as mortars.

In addition, the vehicle itself can be used in the Combat version as an autonomous combat system that can carry a remote-controlled module with an automatic grenade launcher, machine gun, Javelin Anti-tank missile system or 30-mm automatic cannon.

To date, the Ukrainian Defense Forces have 15 THeMIS unmanned ground vehicles at their disposal, which are used to support logistics, evacuate the wounded, and route clearance operations.

To date, Milrem Robotics is the leading global robotics and autonomous systems developer. The company is involved in the development of unmanned systems for the Italian army, and its robotic vehicles participate in a competition to equip the US army.
