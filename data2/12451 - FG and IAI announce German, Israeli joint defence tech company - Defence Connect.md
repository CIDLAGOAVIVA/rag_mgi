The cooperation agreement was signed by both companies at the Berlin Security Conference on 29 November this year.

FTS is expected to utilise a fusion of FFG vehicle systems and IAI product solutions in robotics, autonomous capabilities, artificial intelligence, digitalisation and networks, radar, SIGINT, electronic warfare and situational awareness.

Earlier this month, Israel Aerospace Industries announced it will supply long-range loitering munitions under two contracts worth a combined $145 million.

The separate orders for two unnamed countries follow a previous contract signed earlier this year, which has also declared the purchase of Israel Aerospace Industries’ (IAI) long-range loitering munitions.

IAI long-range loitering munitions include the Harpy NG, the Harpy-derivative HAROP, and Mini Harpy (anti-tank warhead).

This series of orders represents the growing global demand for IAI’s long-range loitering munition family and demonstrates IAI’s unique capability in this market segment, according to IAI president and chief executive officer Boaz Levy.

“Loitering munitions have proven critical to achieving operational success on the battlefield worldwide,” he said.

“The flexibility in strikes that can be achieved with a loitering munition is a major advantage in combat and the type of precision reached is of strategic and national importance.

“The latest orders emphasise the trust in IAI’s loitering munitions family in bringing the required advantages to each country, respectively.”

It also announced earlier this year that it had secured contracts for the supply of Rotem loitering munition drones to three NATO countries in June.

The Israeli aerospace and aviation manufacturer signed separate contracts allegedly worth several millions of dollars for supplies of the vertical take-off and landing, tactical loitering munition, according to a company statement earlier this month.

The Rotem provides an elevated view of the battlefield while in flight using day and night electro-optic sensors while also acting as a weapon of opportunity against targets as they appear.

Rotem can be launched to seek a target but is disarmed if authorisation to attack is not received and returns to be retrieved safely. The system has a loiter time of up to nine hours as well as the capability to hover with an open camera and data link while waiting for the target to emerge.
