In a noteworthy development, Embraer and the Netherlands Industries for Defence & Security have formally endorsed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at expanding collaboration within the Defense and Security sector.



This crucial MoU was officially ratified during the 34th NIDV Exhibition for Defense and Security (NEDS 2023), marking a significant milestone in the strategic alliance between Embraer and the Netherlands. The focus of this agreement extends to ongoing projects associated with the C-390 Millennium and A-29 Super Tucano.

The collaboration between Embraer and NIDV is an augmentation of Embraer’s existing affiliations in the Netherlands. It establishes a comprehensive framework designed to explore additional opportunities aligned with the priorities outlined in the Netherlands’ Defense Industry Strategy.



These opportunities may encompass services and the development of novel capabilities within Embraer’s ongoing projects. This collaborative effort contributes significantly to the advancement and application of military knowledge, technologies, and industrial capabilities within the country. A primary objective remains the integration of contributions from the Dutch ecosystem into the supply chain of the Embraer C-390 program, particularly emphasizing export markets.

Hans Huigen, Director of the NIDV, underscores the importance of this collaboration, recognizing Embraer as a forward-leaning Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with a profound focus on innovation. He believes that Embraer adds substantial value to the Netherlands Defense Technical and Industrial Base.



Bosco da Costa Junior, President and CEO of Embraer Defense & Security, expresses satisfaction with the deepening partnership and anticipates that the collaboration strategies outlined in this MoU will provide additional value to the Dutch defense and security ecosystem, encompassing knowledge institutes and the broader business community.



The contributions from NIDV have further solidified Embraer’s collaboration with the Netherlands defense, technical, and industrial base, aligning seamlessly with the policies of the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.

The partnership is dedicated to advancing innovative solutions in defense and supporting the versatile C-390 Millennium multi-mission platform. Notably, this agreement aligns with several other MoUs involving technological and industrial partners like Fokker Services Group and MultiSIM, as well as esteemed research institutes such as the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (Royal NLR) and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).
