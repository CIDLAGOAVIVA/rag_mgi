On Wednesday 13 December, senior representatives from across the Alliance gathered at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to hold the first meeting of the Defence Industrial Production Board. The Board is a key part of stepping up efforts for defence production - both to increase national capabilities for deterrence and defence, and to replenish the stockpiles that have been depleted by their support to Ukraine. A robust and flexible defence industry contributes to strengthening the Alliance’s deterrence and defence.

Allied experts, joined by the NATO Industrial Advisory Group, discussed national and NATO perspectives on defence industrial capacity, including measures to boost defence production, develop recommendations to address supply chain security and engage more closely with defence industry. The Board will report to the Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD), the committee that brings together the top national officials responsible for defence procurement in NATO member and partner countries.

At the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allied Leaders agreed the Defence Production Action Plan to accelerate joint procurement, boost production capacity and enhance Allies’ interoperability. NATO Allies are committed to sustaining the defence industrial production capacity required in peacetime, crisis and conflict. NATO plays a key role as a convener and standard-setter, helping Allies harmonise their defence procurement demands and helping industry understand Allied requirements so that they can deliver a sustainable supply.
