The UK and Turkey have signed a statement of intent to work closely on improving their bilateral defense partnership and enhancing regional and international security.

The countries will collaborate in their defense industries and identify opportunities for joint training exercises in the Mediterranean, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Security assistance around North Africa and the Middle East was one of the agreement’s most important discussions. Collective aid for Ukraine in the midst of the Russo-Ukrainian war was also discussed.

The move comes amid their growing military cooperation, signified by an agreement signed in 2019 focusing on their shared interest in contributing to international peace and security.

A Long-Standing Alliance

UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the ongoing partnership with Ankara is part of the UK’s dedication to increased collaborations in the defense sector.

“Türkiye stands at the crossroads of three continents and, at a time of such global instability, their influence cannot be underestimated,” he said.

“The agreement we’ve signed will see our relationship go from strength-to-strength and enhance our nations’ defence and security co-operation.”

In July, ministerial meetings between the two countries were held at the International Defence Industry Fair in Istanbul, where equipment, exports, and shared-domain partnership opportunities were discussed.
