As part of the visit to the United States, Head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak met with U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery Penny Pritzker.

The meeting was also attended by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Mykola Tochytskyi, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova, and Advisor to the Head of the Presidential Office Daria Zarivna.

Andriy Yermak noted Penny Pritzker's visit to Ukraine in mid-October and a productive meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The Head of the President's Office noted that Ukraine views the USA – Ukraine Defense Industrial Base Conference as the beginning of promising and fruitful cooperation between the defense industries of the two countries.

"This will pave the way for a new, revived Ukrainian defense industry capable of meeting our needs for military equipment and weapons to win the war against Russia," he said.

The interlocutors noted the high level of participation of American and international defense companies in this conference.

Andriy Yermak emphasized that the state is ready to provide all the necessary support for the work of American defense companies in our country and create conditions for them to start co-production in Ukraine with domestic manufacturers.

The meeting emphasized the importance of insuring the risks of investment projects in our country.

In addition, they discussed the need to strengthen Ukraine's air defense system, which would also facilitate the creation of clusters of defense and other industries.
