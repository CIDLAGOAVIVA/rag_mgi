President Bola Tinubu has signed the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) Bill, 2023, into law, giving a new impetus to the country’s defence industry. The bill, which was sponsored by the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Defence, Babajimi Benson, repeals the previous DICON Act and introduces several reforms and innovations to the corporation.

The bill empowers DICON to operate and maintain subsidiaries and ordnance factories, establish a research and development institute, provide a regulatory framework for the defence sector, and attract private capital to facilitate production and innovation. The bill also aims to make DICON more accountable, transparent, and efficient in its operations and management.

The signing of the bill comes at a time when Nigeria is facing various security challenges, such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, and piracy. The bill is expected to enhance the capacity and capability of the Nigerian military and other security agencies to combat these threats and protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.

The bill also aligns with the vision of President Tinubu to diversify the economy and create jobs for the youth. The bill will enable DICON to produce a wider range of defence products, such as weapons, ammunition, vehicles, uniforms, and equipment, and export them to other countries. The bill will also foster the development of local content and technology transfer in the defence sector, creating opportunities for local manufacturers, suppliers, and researchers.

The signing of the bill is the latest in a series of initiatives taken by President Tinubu to boost Nigeria’s defence industry. In September, the president approved a $1 billion deal with India to modernize DICON’s facilities and increase its local production of defence equipment to 40% by 2027. The deal will also provide DICON with the funding and expertise it needs to produce more sophisticated and advanced products, such as drones, missiles, and radars.

In addition, DICON has been collaborating with other countries and companies to produce and acquire new defence products. In 2020, DICON unveiled the Ezugwu MRAP, a locally made tactical vehicle named after Major General Victor Ezugwu for his bravery in fighting insurgents in the northeast. The vehicle was produced in partnership with the Command Engineering Depot of the Nigerian Army. DICON has also signed a letter of intent with the Polish Armaments Group for the production and technology transfer of Beryl M762 assault rifles in Nigeria. In 2004, DICON successfully produced prototype medium range weapons, such as 60mm mortar, 81mm mortar, and RPG-7, and test-fired them in the presence of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.

Nigerian Army and DICON signed agreement to develop composite armor for military vehicles in 2020.

The Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria was established in 1964 by an Act of Parliament to manufacture, store, and dispose of ordnance and ancillary stores and material for the Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies. The corporation has its headquarters in Kaduna and operates several factories and subsidiaries across the country.

The Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria Bill, 2023, is a landmark legislation that will transform the defence sector and position Nigeria as a regional and global player in the defence industry. The bill will also contribute to the economic growth and development of the country and the welfare and security of its citizens.
