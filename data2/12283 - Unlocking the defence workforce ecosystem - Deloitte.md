Understanding the workers’ perspective in different labour categories. If the skills require deep specialisation to acquire, the worker may not want the general organisational obligations that accompany traditional government employment. If a worker is going to apply the skills in a difficult or dangerous environment, the worker may want the assurances of long-term health, disability, and retirement benefits that are a part of military service. This forms the basis for a fair process for helping workers move to the category that both fits their needs and the organisations.



Paying attention to inclusivity and equity and monitoring if the organisation tends to move more people of one gender or race into a particular model.

Ensuring policies allow you to fully embrace and leverage workers from multiple models. This could include policy allowing flexibility in assigning among military, civilian, contractor, temporary, and gig workers. Other possibilities include alternative specialist career pathways and skills-based remuneration for military and civilian employees.

> This goes beyond just HR policy – commercial policy to make it easier to bring aboard independent contractors and ‘pool’ independent workers make these options more practical for defence organisations. As our research states: “Going forward, functional and business unit leaders need to work together to purposefully and systematically think about the holistic workforce ecosystem.” 13

Like any major change in the defence workforce, it is important to have a strong understanding of the limitations, laws, and regulations that apply to each model. 14 Certain defence missions can only be accomplished by service personnel under the Law of Armed Conflict (see JSP 383), the UK’s Manual of Service Law (JSP 830), the US’s Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and other similar guidance. In addition, certain functions, particularly decision-making functions, must be done by a government employee (service personnel or civil servant) . 15 Also, contract and temporary workers require different assessments around safety, liability, and reputational risks and work that is more sensitive from a security perspective may have to be done by highly vetted employees, which will tend toward more stable labour models.

Challenge: Pivot from directing to orchestrating

Even as an organisation makes the investments needed to complete the concrete steps above, it will take creative approaches to build a cohesive organisational culture when workers have different expectations and engagement to the organisation. It is what we call the “pivot from directing to orchestrating” .16

A critical aspect of this challenge is the necessity to establish a ‘one team’ culture that includes workers from each model employed. Managing teams of people with different obligations and limitations will become increasingly the norm in every organisation. For example, for deployable military units, depending on model, some employees must deploy, some may deploy, and some can never deploy – yet all will still be needed for the mission. 17 Similarly, managers will have to carefully match the security requirements for tasks with workers who have different levels of vetting and monitoring.

The key is not to force managers to treat workers of various models the same 18. In fact, those differences in treatment are part of the attraction of a robust workforce ecosystem for workers. The key is to create a common culture where all workers, regardless of labour model or skills profile, feel fully engaged with the organisation and understand their importance to the mission.

This requires a reorientation in how managers talk with and about their team – shifting the nexus of culture from formal organisational elements to a dedication to a shared mission. Leaders in MOD can begin the change by the way they identify their own roles and how they describe their work. As shared mission, rather than organisation, becomes the key focus of conversation, MOD will need to reinforce the re-conception with the way it identifies and rewards successful leaders.

Who has done it?

As mentioned before, public and private sector organisations across the globe are moving towards robust, fully unlocked workforce ecosystems. The UK MOD has reinforced the concept of the “Defence Nuclear Enterprise,” which considers strategic workforce planning and talent interventions across all workforce components dedicated to the Defence Nuclear mission including serving personnel in multiple front-line commands, civil servants, onsite contractor personnel, and personnel working for defence industry companies.

Among other public sector organisations, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has invested heavily in building the infrastructure necessary to access the highly sought after and ever-evolving skills needed for its unique mission. Similarly, NASA used to have six talent-market platforms spread across multiple units, each of which independently matched employees with projects. Now the space agency uses a single talent marketplace — one orchestrating mechanism — to coordinate access to internal human talent across the organization. Their ultimate vision is “a more ‘porous border,’ where employees can spend a few years working for NASA on a particular project, and then later spend time at another commercial space organization.” 19

Taking next steps to include the external workforce in the overall mission at the corporate level, senior leaders at consumer products company Unilever are working to digitize data and insights about the external workforce as a prerequisite to upskilling external workers – estimated at 3 million - in addition to internal employees – circa 150,000 – to be able to fully and flexibly manage its entire workforce ecosystem. 20

Value waiting to be unlocked

The premise behind this concept is an optimistic one for the UK MOD: The human capital that the MOD needs to fully leverage new systems and technology exists and is available, as long as the MOD employs the right approach to access it. However, that challenge is a significant one and will require leaders and managers in the MOD to adapt to new ways of employing skills and new ways of managing talent. The good news is many organisations across the world have been able to build that capacity to unlock their workforce ecosystems.
