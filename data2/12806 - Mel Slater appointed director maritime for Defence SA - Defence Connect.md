South Australia’s naval shipbuilding sector is undergoing a period of rapid change with maritime programs involving Collins Class submarine maintenance and sustainment, the nuclear-powered submarine program, Hunter Class frigate program, autonomous vessels, Arafura Class offshore patrol vessel program and opportunities from the Defence Strategic Review.

Mr Slater will work alongside outgoing director maritime David Eyre over the coming months to oversee existing programs and further build relationships with industry.

“I am thrilled to accept the role at Defence SA with the key objective to continue the development of the South Australian defence industrial base in their pursuit of emerging opportunities to enhance our sovereign shipbuilding and sustainment capability,” he said.

Mr Slater has more than 35 years of experience in shipbuilding construction, engineering, major project and subcontracts, and senior management positions. He has previously been involved in the Attack Class submarine program and AIR6500 (Joint Air Battle Management System Project), design and construction of the Collins Class submarines, construction of the Hobart Class air warfare destroyers, and projects within the land and air domains.

He also brings formal qualifications in mechanical engineering, project management, PMP, and business management, bringing a broad skill set along with his understanding of all aspects of naval construction, and the establishment and sustainment of sovereign supply chains. His industry experience also includes responsibility for aspects of sourcing within the supply chain through market solicitations, evaluations, subcontract negotiations and executions, with overall cost and schedule responsibilities.

Earlier this year, in July, Defence SA appointed Dr Dave Ormrod as the inaugural director – information warfare. Dr Ormrod also has significant industry experience and brings 25 years of information warfare and cyber security knowledge to the role from work across Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In the role, Dr Ormrod will work with defence industry, federal and state governments, and the cyber security industry.

Dr Ormrod has previous military and industry experience as a graduate of both the Carnegie Mellon University Chief Information Security Officer Program and the US Joint Staff College, Joint Information Operations Planning Course, as well as a PhD in computer science.

For the role, he moved from Canberra to Adelaide after working as a director in the McGrathNicol cyber security risk and strategy business. He has previously led security teams, tailored cyber security solutions, and acted as a trusted adviser and collaborator to C-suite executives.
