The US Department of Defense announced on December 4 that it has signed a contract with Saab Inc., the American division of the Swedish defence company Saab, for the supply of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and related services. The contract, valued at USD 16 million, is entirely for Kuwait and is expected to be fulfilled by September 2025.

The Defense Department, facilitating the order through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) procedure, indicated that Saab would deliver remotely operated underwater vehicles, essential accessories, transport containers, training mines, and a spare parts package. Additionally, the contract encompasses training and instructional services.

While the specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed, Saab’s portfolio includes the Double Eagle family of remotely operated vehicles, designed for mine countermeasure operations.
