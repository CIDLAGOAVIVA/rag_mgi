The Biden administration is struggling to get congressional approval for a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine, half of which would be for weapons sent to Ukraine, and to replenish U.S. stockpiles.

But, long term, both Washington and Kyiv want Ukraine to produce their own weapons, as President Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said this week at a Washington summit.

Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine: Ukraine cannot and will not entirely depend on the foreign providers of the military aid. We must take care of our own defense capability. Moreover, we have our own weapons to be proud of.

Lloyd Austin, U.S. Secretary of Defense: That will mean strengthening Ukraine's defense industrial base, both to maintain Ukraine's current war effort and to bolster Ukraine's national strength and deterrence long into the future.
