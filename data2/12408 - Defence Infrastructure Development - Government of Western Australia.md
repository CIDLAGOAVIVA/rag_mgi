The Defence West Infrastructure Development Team is committed to supporting the growth of the State's defence industry to diversify the economy and create jobs through supporting the nation's current and emerging security needs.

The Defence Strategic Review (DSR) released in April 2023, identified several objectives, including, upgrading and developing our northern network of bases and leveraging the capabilities offered by local and state governments, industry, and academic infrastructure facilities. It also noted the critical role of the Australian Marine Complex in naval shipbuilding and and sustainment.

The Western Australian Government has developed the Australian Marine Complex (AMC) Strategic Infrastructure and Land Use Plan (SILUP) to identify the short-, medium- and long-term upgrades required to guide the AMC's development as a nationally significant industrial area for the defence, marine and resource sectors.

By collaborating across State and Australian governments, Defence West have assisted in the delivery of infrastructure developments at the AMC, including the work that led to the recent commitment by the Australian Government to invest in large vessel infrastructure.

A State-wide Defence Infrastructure Strategy (SDIS) will provide the opportunity for the State to develop infrastructure. SDIS will leverage off the demand for defence capability in Western Australia seeking to identify and analyse infrastructure opportunities.
