Szalay-Bobrovniczky said that the primary purpose of his visit was to directly express the Hungarian government’s solidarity with the Jewish state after the Hamas terror attack in October. He also added that

we have supported and will continue to support Israel’s right to self-defense in all form”.

The minister disclosed that their talks with Defense Minister Joav Gallant focused on current security and defense policy issues, as well as on the review of bilateral military relations and cooperation in the defense industry.

The talks were also attended by the heads of ELBIT, RAFAEL and IAI defense companies. During the visit, the Hungarian-Israeli Military Cooperation Agreement (MoU) was signed, which is a precondition for further defense industrial cooperation between the two countries, the officials said. Kristóf Szalay-Bobrovniczky recalled that the renewal air defense, which is one of the foundations of Hungarian security, is also linked to Israel.

The Hungarian government has purchased elements of Israel’s well-known and respected Iron Dome system, which, together with the US-Norwegian NASAMS missiles form Hungary’s 21st century high-tech air defense,” the statement said. Hungary is also involved in the acquisition of Hero loitering munitions (better known as ‘kamikaze drones’), designed by the Israeli company UVision and manufactured by the German Rheinmetall. The deliveries are set to begin in 2024 and conclude in 2025.
