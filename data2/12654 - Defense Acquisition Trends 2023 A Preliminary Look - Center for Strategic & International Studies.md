The Issue

Over the past year, the defense acquisition system has continued to face changes and to shift its priorities in response to the broader strategic landscape. These transformations will continue in 2024, as the new National Defense Industrial Strategy is released to shape priorities and as external challenges continue to pose riddles for the acquisition system to help solve. Understanding the most recent data on acquisition trends helps shed light on the past and creates a baseline of knowledge to use to better understand future acquisition. Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 contracting faced multiple external influences: the tail end of Covid-19 responses and supply chain disruptions, increasing inflation, and large-scale U.S. support to Ukraine. Despite all this, FY 2022 defense contract spending showed marked continuity with the prior year. Contract spending grew 0.1 percent after applying a 6.9 percent rate of inflation. Spending on ordnance and munitions slowly ramped up, falling in FY 2022 with real gains not seen until the preliminary FY 2023 data. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) spending fell further as commercial contracts took over as the mechanism of choice for responding to Covid-19. Finally, the largest shift in contracting approaches has been the burgeoning use of incentive fee contracts in FY 2023, suggesting that the Department of Defense (DoD) may be turning to this instrument to balance cost-controls and flexibility when addressing defense industrial base challenges.

Introduction

According to Dr. Laura D. Taylor-Kale, the assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy, the Department of Defense (DoD) has “seen in the response to COVID and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that our industrial ecosystem needs to be ready to provide the capabilities that the department needs.”[1] The driving forces for change are the rapidly changing threat environments across the globe. Specifically, the ongoing war in Ukraine, tensions in the Indo-Pacific, and now a budding war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas threaten to strain the United States’ defense industrial base for the foreseeable future.

This brief illustrates the state of the defense acquisition system in FY 2022 as it pivoted to a world shaped by Russia’s expanded invasion of Ukraine. In a bid to capture the impact the war in Ukraine has had on acquisition, this brief incorporates FY 2023 year-to-date (YTD) data where possible.[2] Defense contract obligations were broadly steady, showing 0.1 percent real growth after applying a 6.9 percent measure of inflation. Efforts in FY 2022 to supply Ukraine and recapitalize drawdowns had not yet shifted the flow of DoD contracting dollars. Certain platform portfolios, which intuitively should have experienced dramatic increases because of the security assistance sent to Ukraine, such as ordnance and missiles, have either decreased or experienced mild increases that likely do not reflect forthcoming demand from the DoD. A spending lag was most likely occurring as a component of the institutions and processes that underpin the United States’ procurement and acquisition system.

However, defense contract obligations are set to continue to rise as the acquisition ecosystem responds to the significant presidential drawdowns which accompanied the Biden administration’s assistance to Ukraine in FY 2022.[3] This will replace the equipment that was provided to Ukraine to support its self-defense with modernized stockpiles. By the first quarter of FY 2023 the decline in ordnance and missile spending had already begun to reverse and other key developments not yet shown in acquisition reporting promise further growth.

This brief provides insight on pertinent trends in acquisition and bases its analysis on data collected from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), which is downloaded in bulk from USAspending.gov. OTA data is accessed through SAM.gov. For this brief, the CSIS Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group analyzed data from FY 1990 to Q2 of FY 2023. All figures are in constant FY 2022 dollars, which are calculated with the Office of Management and Budget’s gross domestic product deflators.[4]

For this brief, the CSIS Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group focuses on five overarching themes:
