Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh alluded to defense cooperation during his visit on Thursday to Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), a major manufacturer of aerospace products and services based in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey.

Representatives of Turkey and TAI briefed PM Chinh on strengths of Turkey’s defense industry.

According to them, TAI is a leading Turkish defense company that engages in the design, development, modernization, manufacturing, integration, and life cycle support of integrated aerospace systems.

Among its manufacturing plants, TAI has a modern aircraft manufacturing facility with hi-tech machines and equipment.

TAI’s main products range from high-resolution national reconnaissance satellite Göktürk-2, medium-range twin-engined transport aircraft CASA/IPTN CN-235 to unmanned aerial vehicles.

A TAI leader said the company looks to strengthen its cooperation with Vietnam in some projects and cooperation events launched earlier.

Last year, TAI representatives attended the Vietnam International Defense Exhibition hosted by the Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense.

PM Chinh said that Turkey had experienced tough periods during which it was restrained from cooperating with other countries.

After that, Turkey made huge efforts to develop its defense industry based on advanced technology, with its heavily-invested aviation sector able to satisfy domestic demand and the need for export.

The Vietnamese cabinet leader thanked Turkey for supporting and collaborating with Vietnam in the defense industry.

Vietnam is fully aware that its key mission is to firmly protect its independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, PM Chinh asserted.

To do so, Vietnam needs to modernize the defense industry using modern and practical approaches in line with the country’s national defense and military strategies, he said.

The top Vietnamese official proposed that both sides explore the possibility of fostering their cooperation based on each side’s demand and ability, especially in the defense industry.
