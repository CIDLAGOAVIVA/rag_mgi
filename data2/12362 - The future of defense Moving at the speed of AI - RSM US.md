Technology is the key to our nation maintaining its global competitive advantage. We are accustomed to hearing about corporate strategies, but do nations have strategies as well? They do, and a nation’s strategy is commonly referred to as an industrial policy. The United States’ industrial policy includes vertically integrating defense manufacturing by reshoring semiconductor production and investing in research and development to create the technology needed to compete globally, providing the bandwidth, tactical prowess and speed to defend our nation.

As tensions continue to rise between the U.S. and China, and conflicts persist elsewhere in the world, our nation’s leaders are assessing the current state of our military. The technology our defense industrial base provides will be vital in maintaining a competitive military advantage over near-peer threats with greater size and scale.

The government will likely leverage the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and further development of unmanned vehicles to accelerate military capacity while improving tactical prowess. Government contractors, in turn, will need to align their strategies and enhance their functional operations to meet the demands of their federal government customers with equal speed and technical advancement.
