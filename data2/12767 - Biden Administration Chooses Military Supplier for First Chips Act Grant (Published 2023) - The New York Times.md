At an event at BAE Systems in Nashua, N.H., Gina Raimondo, the commerce secretary, said that the United States had become “dangerously reliant” on a few countries in Asia for its chips, including technology that goes into military systems. Posters showing a pilotless drone, fighter pilots and a jet engine were displayed behind her.

“In order to defend our great country, we need to make the chips that go into military equipment in the United States of America, by Americans,” Ms. Raimondo said. “And that’s what this is about.”

In the coming months, the Biden administration is expected to announce much larger grants for major semiconductor manufacturing facilities run by companies like Intel, Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, known as TSMC. Ms. Raimondo said that within the next year, the department would announce 10 or 12 grants to other companies, some of them worth several billions of dollars and other in the tens of millions.

Speaking after the event, Ms. Raimondo said that the commerce department had “purposefully” chosen a relatively small award as its first grant but said bigger sums to other firms would be announced next year. Awards for facilities that make the most advanced chips are likely to be announced in the first months of 2024, she said in an interview.

“Fundamentally, you’ll see, all over the country, big expansions in semiconductor manufacturing and the supply chain,” she said.
