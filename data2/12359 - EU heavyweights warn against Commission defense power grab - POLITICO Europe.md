They don't object to Brussels' aspiration to make it easier for European companies to compete against their Pentagon-backed rivals, but nor do they want the Commission playing the lead role at the expense of national capitals.

“We support the overall ambition of the Commission to strengthen” the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB), the countries write in a three-page unofficial document, called a non-paper in diplomatic language.

“It is therefore important to focus on actions in a bottom-up approach from the early stages of the production chain, notably on innovation and R&D,” the document continues. “Such actions would also naturally result in incentivizing joint acquisition of the end products.”

In early 2024, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton is expected to present a European Defence Industrial Strategy to help support the Continent’s military industrial complex.

The EU’s executive branch has circulated several papers to national delegations to get their views on what the strategy should look like.

The non-paper of France, Germany, Sweden and Italy has been discussed in the workshops the Commission is organizing with member states ahead of the strategy’s presentation. According to an EU diplomat involved in the discussion, who was allowed to speak anonymously to talk freely, nine countries have signed on to the letter and others could join.
