Marles will be at the center of implementing the three-way agreement between the U.S., UK and Australia known as AUKUS, which is moving beyond an agreement to share technology that will allow for production of conventionally armed, nuclear-propelled submarines to include development of additional technologies such as hypersonic weapons.
