At the beginning of the war, the EU had to adapt its defense industry to wartime conditions. Europe will increase its military aid to Ukraine to 480,000 shells by the end of the year, and next year it will increase its ammunition production capacity to one million shells per year, said EC President Ursula von der Leyen.

“Russia fires 10 million projectiles a year. Ukraine uses 10,000 drones a month. This means the European defense industry must also mobilize,” von der Leyen stressed.

At the NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs meeting, the head of British diplomacy, David Cameron, emphasized that the NATO countries should jointly increase weapons production so that Ukraine has the means to defeat Russia. The Alliance must use all its potential to provide the Ukrainian military with firearms for at least the next two years.

He added that the combined economic power of the Alliance is 30 times greater than Russia’s.
