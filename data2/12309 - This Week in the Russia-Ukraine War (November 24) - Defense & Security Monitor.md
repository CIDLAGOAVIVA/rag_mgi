A snapshot of recent news from sources around the world on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

Political Developments

The U.S. will host a two-day Defense Industrial Base Conference on December 6th and 7th to identify opportunities for co-production of military equipment and other areas of cooperation. The meeting will involve participants from U.S. and Ukrainian industry.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin travelled to Ukraine November 20 to discuss ways to improve the strategic relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine. Austin is also hosting the 17th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which involves coordination of nearly 50 nations in support of Ukraine.

There is growing concern in the White House that Iran may provide Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war in Ukraine.

Military Assistance to Ukraine

The Netherlands will provide over two billion euros ($2.19 billion) to Ukraine next year, most of which will be in the form of military assistance. Some of the funding will also be used for recovery, reconstruction, and cybersecurity. Replenishing ammunition is the most pressing near-term priority, as well as bolstering Ukraine’s air defense capabilities.

Germany announced a military aid package for Ukraine worth 1.3 billion euros ($1.42 billion). The package includes four additional IRIS-T air defense systems, 20,000 155mm artillery shells, and anti-tank mines. Berlin has promised to provide eight IRIS-T systems so far, three of which have been handed over to Ukraine.

The U.S. announced a $100 million security assistance package for Ukraine that includes Stinger air defense missiles, a HIMARS launcher and ammunition, artillery rounds, anti-tank missiles, small arms ammunition, and other gear.

Deliveries of 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine have slowed down since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, as some ammunition is being redirected to Israel. Ukraine is using 24,000 shells a month, and the high usage rate is resulting in shortages across the front lines.

Battlefield Updates

Ukrainian officials said on November 21 that its air defenders intercepted attack drones and a missile fired by the Russian military. The Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed nine drones and an Iskander-K cruise missile.
