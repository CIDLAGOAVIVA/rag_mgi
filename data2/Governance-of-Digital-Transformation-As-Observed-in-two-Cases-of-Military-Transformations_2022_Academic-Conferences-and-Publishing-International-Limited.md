Abstract : The transformation of a modern socio-technical system is challenging. Notably, the digital transformation of an enterprise's  business  or  operational  model  is  an  arduous  journey  toward  success.  Recent  studies  illustrate  that  70%  of business enterprise digital transformations fall short of their objectives. Without revenue-based performance indicators, the digital  transformations  of  military  organisations  are,  if  possible,  even  more  challenging.  However,  governance  methods should assist in the complex transformation of interrelated features like human behaviour, business processes, information, data, and technology. Are they applied, and how feasible the standard Information and Communications Technology (ICT) governance methods are in supporting digital transformation in the defence sector? The paper studies how feasible the contemporary ICT -governance methods are for military organisations while executing digital transformation. The research implements the action research method since the researcher has participated in two journeys of military transformation. First, a review of these two cases shows the military utilisation of the governance methods and models. Second, the standard methods are reflected against the most challenging transformation problems to see if they could provide support. Third, the methods are challenged by the range of variety in complex system transformations to test their flexibility. Based on the research on two digital transformations, military enterprises seem to fall short in applying central ICT governance standards and methods. Therefore, they are not getting the best available support. Secondly, the contemporary governance methods do not address all the pain points in military transformation. Hence, the utilisation degree and transformation benefits are not well correlated. Thirdly, modern governance tools are inflexible in addressing various situations, transformation goals, and organisational maturity. In summary, the research surfaces some new gaps within the contemporary ICT governance toolbox when applied to the complex socio-technical transformation in the defence sector.

## 1. Introduction

Digital transformations are not straightforward in any sector. Private enterprises face challenges, according to a Forbes study of enterprise failures in digital transformations (Council, 2021). The study indicates that 70% of transformation  projects  fall  short  of  their  goals  and  advises  organisations  to  pay  attention  to  their  data, onboarding process, the coherency of existing technical foundation, resistance to change, communication and coordination. A Boston Consulting Group survey (Forth; Reichert; de Laubier &amp; Chakraborty, 2020) confirms the failure  rate  stating  that  as  80%  of  companies  plan  to  accelerate  their  digital  transformations,  the  people dimension is the determining factor in success. The public sector is not doing any better. A study of the EU and national level challenges in digital transformation (Svarc, Laznjak, &amp; Dabic, 2020) shows that social capital and working skills were predictors of success at the national level. The exact correlation emerges from a study of smart city transformations (Kar, Ilavarasan, Janssen, &amp;  Kothari, 2019). Since Gartner defines digital transformation as 'the process of exploiting digital technologies and supporting capabilities to create a robust new business model' (Gartner, 2004), surely ICT governance methods will help exploit digital technologies and improve the success of transformations.

ICT governance (ISO/IEC, 2015) belongs under the organisation governance (ISO/IEC, 2021), and the ISO/IEC 38500  standard  provides  guiding  principles  for  'effective,  efficient,  and  acceptable  use  of  IT  within  an organisation'.  For  the  support  of  transformation,  it  defines  principles  for  strategy,  acquisition,  and  human performance,  among  other  things.  The  38500  also  promotes  existing  good  practices  to  address  different approaches for management, in particular, change management, process management, and business model. The ICT governance methods should effectively support transformation programmes since digital transformation  has  been  recognised  for  over  ten  years  as  crucial  to  performance  improvements,  business advantages, and even survival in the future (Digital Adoption, 2021).

Military organisations are also seeking operational performance and advantageous capabilities through digital transformations. It seems that they are facing similar challenges to other sectors. This paper uses action research while observing two military transformations to see how feasible the contemporary ICT governance methods are for military organisations while executing digital transformation. The sequenced research sub-questions are:

## Juha Kai Mattila

- 1. How greatly are armed forces utilising standard ICT governance methods?
- 2. How well do the methods mitigate the challenges of military DT?
- 3. How do the methods address the dynamics in different transformation approaches?

The paper is divided into the literature research section to understand how military works, whether they have special  challenges  in  their  transformations,  how  common  ICT  governance  methods  map  to  military  line command, and the general difficulties in digital transformations. The research design section explains how the researcher used the action research and provides some essential information about the two use cases that remain otherwise anonymous. The results and discussion section provides causality and answers to the three detailed questions. Finally, the conclusion section summarises the paper.

## 2. Literature Research

The section seeks first to create a general model for military affairs and operational types. Secondly, it defines the  nature  of  a  military  organisation  and  its  reaction  to  change.  Thirdly,  the  study  tries  to  recognise  the foundational frameworks and methods for ICT governance that makes the most sense for the military.  As a result, the section composes a context and model for understanding the ICT branch within military organisations, maps ICT governance to this organisation, and reviews some common failures in military digital transformations.

## 2.1 How Military Works and Transforms

Military  affairs  typically  comprise  force  utilisation,  generation,  and  support  (Smith,  2005).  By  tradition,  the military is a line command functional organisation with some matrix processes commonly for supplies and longrange fire support. (Mattila &amp; Parkinson, 2018) The history of symmetric battles, i.e., land, maritime, and air, has determined the basic operational model as semi-independent functional stovepipes called Services. (Bosquet, 2009) Nevertheless, many efforts have been made to compose a military organisation that could utilise Joint capabilities (components from different Services used together in operation) (Vego, 2007). Since 1983, the US DoD has operated with global combatant commands for force utilisation, but each force is a construct from components provided by the original Service. (U.S. CENTCOM, 2022) Some armed forces have established Joint logistics and educational functions to support all Services, but force generation typically remains distributed within each Service. (Mattila &amp; Parkinson, 2018)

Military organisations and cultures are optimised to maintain their integrity when the environment is chaotic and lethal on the battlefield. (Dupuy, 1987, pp. 63-74) Hence, transferring fundamental structures or ways of military  affairs  may  be  perceived  to  question  the  established  understanding  and  the  existence  of  a  military organisation.  (Kegan  &amp;  Lahey,  2009,  ss.  56-60)  Possibly,  the  hierarchical  military  organisation  possesses immunity or resistance to change, which determines transformation as either adding a new organisation for a new function, consolidating similar functions, distributing parts, or erasing a part from the legacy organisation.

For example, the Defence Forces of Finland has erased units and consolidated functions in their 2008 (Finland, 2009) and 2015 (Prime Minister's Office Finland, 2012) foundational transformations. Conversely, there are several examples of military intentions to transfer their affairs or operational models but failing to reach the end state.  (Mattila  &amp;  Parkinson,  2018)  The  challenges  appear  in  all  layers  of  the  organisational  structure.  One common nominator for challenges may be the functionally distributed hierarchical power structure, as defined by Otto Scharmer (Wilson, 2017), which resisted all changes except in Sweden, where the change of political agenda halted the digitalisation and integration of the Försvarsmakten (Hartman, 2020). Besides getting the buy-in from generals, each transformation has struggled with the lack of competencies or the speed of transfer for people to keep up.

## 2.2 ICT Governance Methods for Transformation

A successful transformation requires an organisation to focus its resources and efforts on gaining future value while  mitigating  risks  on  the  journey.  (Cameron  &amp;  Green,  2012,  ss.  117-118)  There  are  several  pathways (Eastwood,  2022)  for  digital  transformations,  but  all  of  them  require  strategy,  resources,  and  performance governance. Meanwhile, the enablers (ISACA, 2019), like competency, information, and technology, need to be acquired to support the efforts. The governance of this flux of movement and interrelated enablers is described in the ISO/IEC 38500 (ISO/IEC, 2015) concerning the organisational governance of information technology. The standard could be considered an umbrella framework for information and communications-related governance in  an  enterprise  (Van  Haren  Publishing,  2013)  since  it  recognises  the  primary  IT  business  value  stream  of development and operations together with the core functions of governance, i.e., monitor, evaluate, and direct

## Juha Kai Mattila

(Almaawi,  Alsaggaf,  &amp;  Fasihuddin,  2020).  Moreover,  the  framework  connects  business  and  IT  strategy,  risk management, operations, and change together with the architectural structure of the system (Calder &amp; Moir, 2009), as illustrated in Table 1.

## 2.3 Mapping the Common Governance Methods to Military Affairs

In a typical enterprise, the business and operation models define governance implementation.  Hence, there is a need to determine the essential business and operation model for the ICT-service production within a military enterprise and then arrange the IT-governance practices fitting the model.  The Beers (Espejo, 1990) Viable Systems Model provides a structure for ICT business interfaces and levels of decision-making for the start. On top of the structure, the military prefers an in-house service provider and on-premises infrastructure because of  autonomy and security reasons, as illustrated in Figure 1,  left-hand  side.  Therefore,  there  is  an  in-house service relationship between the ICT provider and units using the software as a service.

Furthermore, the ICT provider may have many sub-providers and vendors to manage in the supply chain. In summary, the value stream (Toivonen &amp; Siitonen, 2016) to support current operations with ICT-related services is composed of end-users, an in-house ICT service provider running service development, delivery, and support functions, and the supply chain connecting vendors and other service providers to support the in-house service provider. Next, there is enterprise information management which focuses on content and knowledge. Finally, at  the  strategic  level,  there  is  an  enterprise  information  governance  level  focusing  on  knowledge  capital preparedness for future scenarios. Together the ICT value stream and enterprise-level  functions establish a generic ICT model for Armed Forces.

Matching the ISO 38500 preferred governance methods to the generic Armed Forces ICT model presented in Figure 1 (left-hand side), the essential tools map looks like Figure 1 (right-hand side). ISO 38500 establishes an umbrella for enterprise information governance at a strategic level, COBIT covers most of the management functions,  and  P3M3  and  TOGAF  provide  essentials  for  change  management.  Furthermore,  ICT  service development and production are arranged compliant with ITIL and SCM processes within the eTOM business model, and enterprise-wide information and security management should follow the lines of data management and ISO 27001. The ICT model and mapping of governance tools will be used in the paper to establish the required context for the governance tool analysis.

## 2.4 Transformation challenges

For the past decade or so, digital transformation has been the foremost way to accelerate or revolutionise operational performance or business revenue. For example, over the last five years, the end-user experience has improved by more than 70% of cases. However, late surveys point out that 80% of enterprise transformation intentions fail, suffer delays, or be scaled back. (Couchbase, 2022) Nevertheless, with a 30 % annually increased investment,  digital  transformation  continues  to  be  significant  pressure  from  outside  or  the  way  to  make  a difference inside an enterprise. (McKinsey, 2020) Both Couchbase and McKinsey surveys recognise causality between the failures and the following layers of organisation: culture, strategy, processes, human competency, information &amp; data, technology and other resources. A third survey indicates that transformation may fail during the  target  setting  (22%),  planning  (23%),  implementation  (35%)  and  post-transformation  (20%)  phases. (McKinsey, 2021) The recognised common challenges faced in digital transformations will set the reference to analyse ICT governance tools' abilities in mitigating obstacles along the transformation journey in section 4.2.

## 3. Research Design

The transformation of a military organisation remains complex because of social relationships, various obstacles on the journey, culture, language, and different perceptions of stakeholders. Hence, the interpretive approach seemed to be an applicable worldview for the research. (Saunders, Lewis, &amp; Thornhill, 2015) Furthermore, Action Research  appeared  to  be  the  most  related  method  for  study  since  the  researcher  participated  (Reason  &amp; Bradbury, 2012) in planning and implementing transformations of two different armed forces (Case A and B). The self-reflective spiral of action research (Kemmis &amp; McTaggart, 2000) followed in both cases the sequence of 1. identifying the competency gaps, 2. consulting the planning team towards applicable methods, 3. applying methods to planning, 4. transferring the organisational behaviour, 5. migrating the ICT infrastructure and data, 6.  measuring  the  short-term  outcome  and  performance,  7.  improving  the  competency  of  the  planning  and control team, and 8. adjusting the plan and implementation accordingly.

The self-reflecting spiral ensured opportunities to observe, learn, and adjust the course whilst taking short steps on  the  transformation  journey  (Koshy,  2010).  Hence,  there  were  several  opportunities  to  introduce  ICT governance methods as they became understandable, and the opportunity emerged on the journey. As a result, the main principles of action research (Carr &amp; Kemmis, 1989) were fulfilled as follows:

- · The researcher participated in both cases between 2-7 years, providing longevity for the viewpoint.
- · The researcher engaged the actors in the senior consultant role, so the relationship's peer nature was as close as possible to typical military culture.
- · The action included several spirals of planning, observing, reflecting, and re-planning.

The two digital transformations (A and B), that the researcher participated in this study, were different in their nature. Therefore, the data collected during the action research provides various points along the transformation journeys. The research uses the EA Tool (Mattila J. K., 2020) to analyse the current position (AS-

IS) and intended end states (TO-BE) from the information and ICT technology viewpoint, as presented in Table 2.

Naturally, the researcher's language, knowledge, attitude, and perception in every engagement with others impact the observations. Also, long-time engagement evolves understanding and relationships, which naturally affects the observations.

## 4. Results and Discussion

The section provides first a view of how greatly the two cases recognise and utilise the essential ICT governance methods and tools. Secondly, it shows how the governance methods address the prevalent challenges of digital transformation in military culture. Thirdly, the section approaches governance tools from a dynamic viewpoint and assesses how well the tools manage the transformation from AS-IS to TO-BE. Finally, the section discusses the causality between the usage of governance tools and the ability to navigate the transformation journey and cope with dynamics.

## 4.1 Degree of Utilisation

While doing the action research, the researcher observed the organisation's policies, proposed improvements to increase the transformation success, and followed some adoption of these proposals. However, since both cases  did  not  transfer  their  strategy  or  process  postures,  the  researcher  adopted  a  pragmatic  approach  of promoting whatever part or feature was feasible in the context of time, competency, and culture. As a result, both cases end up using some viable details of the selected ICT governance methods, as illustrated in Table 3.

Neither of the cases used the standard ICT governance methods entirely, purely, nor necessarily acknowledged. Nevertheless,  the  researcher  and  transformation  programmes  used  parts  of  methods  as  either  a  seed  for knowledge that hopefully will sprout in the future or a tailored tool to address a recognised challenge. Hence, the research does not measure the maturity of the governance tool utilisation but their feasibility in governing the transformation.

## 4.2 Feasibility in Mitigating Transformation Challenges

The feasibility of the governance methods depends on the challenges, utilisation of the tools and the journey of transformation. The research combines the challenges detected from military and private organisations into themes reflected in the standard governance tools in Table 4. The reflection of the challenge theme defines how much practical support the research observed from each tool or method.

There is no one method to manage all typical challenges of military ICT transformations, but a need to combine them for a purpose. The need for combination supports the researcher's intent to apply whatever mitigates commonly recognised problems. For  example, transferring  and  building  up  the  social  structure  and  human competencies receive weak support from the standard tools. This weakness requires help from other methods, like  systems  thinking,  organisational  behaviour,  and  business  dynamics.  The  assistance  in  understanding organisational dynamics in the transformation does not appear in the above reflection. Since the transformation is about the migration of data and technology, the transition of individual competencies and habits, business transformation,  and  the  organisational  dynamics  viewpoint  (Burke  &amp;  Litwin,  1992)  ask  for  a  separate assessment.

## 4.3 Governing the Dynamics of Transformation

Next, the research assesses the dynamics along the evolutionary path by applying the EA Tool (Mattila J. K., 2020)  but  simplifying  the  study  by  focusing  on  three  layers  within  the  main  focus,  i.e.,  ICT  business,  ICT operations, and technology. Table 5 samples the most critical gaps in the ICT governance methods found when managing the dynamics of migration, transition, and transformation. Nevertheless, the paper does not analyse more complex powers and forces between organisational components in motion.

The dynamics of the ICT transformation challenge the existing governance methods in three areas:

- 1. Transformation goes beyond the range - methods follow progress with a delay. However, they do not define the behaviour on the edge of development.
- 2. Transformation fast forwards - methods presume a level of understanding and maturity between the slow steps of evolution.
- 3. Social and cognitive immunities to change - the focus is on managing things and transactions rather than the transition of interrelationships.

## 4.4 Discussion

Based on these two cases, the military does not systematically utilise the common ICT governance frameworks and methods. Whether this is because officers' training does not include these subjects or military command and control culture is too strong to tolerate frail matrix governance methods, remains outside of this research. Nevertheless,  the  ability  of  military  personnel  with  various  backgrounds  to  adopt  applicable  parts  of  these methods was remarkable once the challenge was recognised and ownership shared. Therefore, the complete application of ICT governance methods does not guarantee effortless transformation, but shared challenges and applied remedies make the success more predictable.

From a cultural perspective, the military organisation seems more prone to stability than agility (Kale, 2020). Thus, military digital transformations should be slow-paced or short steps and well within the scope of existing ICT governance methods for improved outcomes. Similarly, some ICT transformations in academic organisations have benefitted from applying good practices when consolidating university ICT. (Toleman, Cater-STeel, Kissel, Chown, &amp; Thompson, 2009) Sometimes, the military transformations do not recognise their cultural heritage but launch ambitious programmes to gain an advantage or fast forward to meet the adversary's capabilities. Consequently, the culture of society and the competencies of individuals often hold down the realisation of transformation programmes and existing ICT governance methods do not support mitigating these problems. Hence, understanding enterprise sub-cultural structure is essential for the success of any transformation. (Pew &amp; Mavour, 1998)

The ICT governance methods recognise all essential components (technology, information, competency) and aspects (performance, resources, strategy, value/risk) for transformation, but they remain enterprise-focused. Therefore,  they  require  extensions  from  supply  chain,  value  stream,  and  digital  and  knowledge  economy management  methods.  (Kale  V.,  2020)  Furthermore,  good  ICT  governance  practices  seem  to  fit  well  for consolidated, hierarchically managed enterprise ICT services. In contrast, the fitting may be less feasible when ICT is distributed into autonomous business units or spread over the length of the value chain. (Loukis, Janssen, Dawes, &amp; Zheng, 2016)

## Juha Kai Mattila

The strategy should focus on utilising organisational resources to achieve an advantage, but, except for balanced scorecard and portfolio management, centralised ICT governance methods do not support the acquisition and orchestration of resources within distributed, hierarchical, and functionally separated military organisations. (De Vries,  2010)  Hence,  the  alignment  of  effort  remains  loose,  and  cooperation  between  military  Services  is challenging. At least, the importance of consolidating strategic alignment and ICT governance mechanisms has been  proven  productive  in  private  sector  organisations.    (Wu,  Straub,  &amp;  Liang,  2015)  The  military  has  the challenge of valuating their ICT performance and investments since their 'business value' does not reflect on the financial figures as clearly as the private sector. (De Haes &amp; Van Gremberg, 2015)

In conclusion, there is no one ICT governance tool to master digital transformation in military organisations. The feasibility of methods depends on the pace, length of the leap, and ambition of the transformation. Since the ICT governance methods often evolve behind the edge of evolution, they may not be the best practice to seek support for fast-forwarding or edge advantage-seeking transformations. In any case, it seems that successful orchestration of digital transformation requires a combination of governance methods tailored to the particular posture and target of the organisation.

## 5. Conclusions

The  statistics  show  that  70%  or  more  of  digital  transformations  are  falling  short  of  their  initial  goals. Nevertheless, over 80% of organisations plan to gain performance or business advantages. Military organisations are also facing challenges in their transformations to gain advantages. The ICT governance and management methods should provide support in utilising digital technology and improve the success of the transformation. Is the  military  not  using  good  practices?  Are  good  practices  not  addressing  the  challenges  of  military transformation? Are good practices unable to manage the dynamics of a digital transformation?

The ISO 38500 promoted principles and management methods map well onto the Armed Forces' general ICT business model. However, none of the two cases fully recognised or utilised any governance or management methods. Nevertheless, both cases could use parts of the toolbox to improve their success in transforming the ICT branch once the challenge was recognised and the tool was identified and shared. On the other hand, there is no evidence that full compliance with the good practices would even enhance the transformation's success. The  results  indicate  that  sub-cultures  of  organisation,  competency  of  people,  and  arrangements  of  military affairs significantly affect the application of good governance practices.

Based on the action participation, there is no one governance method to address the usual challenges of digital transformation. Moreover, even utilising the complete toolbox promoted in ISO 38500 does not provide full coverage  as  social  structure,  human  competencies  and  acquisition  of  resources  remain  weakly  supported. Hence, the governance toolbox requires an extension of, at least, systems thinking, organisational behaviour, business  dynamics,  and  supply  chain  management.  Transformation  may  need  more  leadership  than  good practices in management.

The transformation dynamics, interrelating forces between organisational components, affect the outcome of digital transformation. However, the toolbox of good governance did not support when transformation reached further towards the edge of development, when the intention was fast forward the organisation, or when social structure  was  exceptionally  immune  to  change.  Therefore,  it  requires  a  tailored  approach  to  apply  good governance practices in a wide variation of ICT transformations.

The lack of public data concerning military digital transformations makes this research relatively unique from an academic viewpoint. Action research may be one of the best ways to gather reliable data with the proper context from  military transformations  that extend  over several years and  have  many  rotating  stakeholders. Transformation practitioners should be relieved as there are no signs that full implementation of the governance toolbox makes transformation successful. On the contrary, tailored application of tools to mitigate recognised challenges seems to create a better impact.

The focus of the research is limited only to ICT transformations and does not observe a broader transformation of military affairs. Moreover, the information concerning affairs and operational performance transformations would be further  constrained  for  operational  security  reasons.  Nevertheless,  the  in-house  transformational experts, who have access to confidential information, may extend and build on this research. Furthermore, the

## Juha Kai Mattila

constrained understanding of one researcher engaging in two transformations can be mitigated in the future by a multi-discipline research  team  that  composes  observations  from  several  viewpoints,  i.e.,  sociology, psychology, business, information, and engineering, and even create a better governance framework for digital transformations.
