Egypt’s defence industry has made significant strides in 2023, with the development of new weapons and equipment that are helping modernise the country’s Armed Forces.

For this reason, the Egyptian Mail has been keen to monitor Egypt’s defence and military industries during 2023.

This report will throw light on new weapons and equipment, from ground vehicles to industrial and technical development, air defence, naval defence, shipbuilding, maintenance and repair, cyber security, missile systems, autonomous and unmanned systems, parachuting, airdrops, satellite communications, search and rescue systems, surveillance systems, tactical equipment, training and simulation equipment.

Al-Gabbar MEKO A200

The Egyptian Navy announced the launch of Al-Gabbar MEKO A200 frigate. It equipment manufactured at the Alexandria Shipyard by Egyptians. Three frigates of the Gowind type were manufactured at the same shipyard in co-operation with France.

Al-Gabbar MEKO A200 is a multi-purpose frigate with medium displacement and heavy armament. It includes the latest marine technologies.

In addition, MEKO was designed from special materials and composition to be classified as a stealth ship.

It has a German design that is manufactured by Egyptians 100%. The next version of the upcoming Egypt Defence Expo is expected to be 100% Egyptian.

The frigate provides support for Special Forces in search, rescue and humanitarian operations. The MEKO frigate is an ideal model for the early warning system.

The design of the frigate is characterised by its stealth, high sailing abilities and the operation of boats and helicopters in various weather and maritime conditions. The frigate is characterised by the ability to carry two helicopters.

Egyptian Navy Shipyard

The Egyptian Navy Shipyard has unveiled six new naval units, including the Swift-28 landing craft. Eleven units and another six units are being produced in co-operation with the American company Swift.

A Rafale 1200 RIB, which is suitable for use by the Navy’s Special Forces, was also produced in co-operation with the French side. Twenty units have been produced and another five units are in the making.

The shipyard also unveiled the Freedom 2 ship, a challenging mission for the shipyard’s capabilities because it includes moving platforms and handling equipment, which require high precision in manufacturing and installation.

The shipyard also displayed the Voith Schneider and Azimuth tugboats, the first of which is used for towing and manoeuvring ships inside ports, in addition to rescue and fire fighting operations.

The second tugboat is characterised by its strength, durability, manoeuvrability, and operation by a small number of crew members.

The Egyptian Navy Shipyard is one of the largest in the Arab and African regions. It witnessed significant developments under President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.

In 2016, the shipyard signed its first contract to build three Gowind-class frigates at the Alexandria Shipyard. Building warships is a very complex industry that requires special skills.

The Alexandria Shipyard was founded in 1831 and then re-established in 1962 to be a modern and integrated shipyard for building and repairing ships on the Mediterranean Sea.

The shipyard’s responsibility was moved to the Ministry of Defence in 2007 under the management of the Naval Industries and Services Authority.

The shipyard’s equipment, workshops, and shipbuilding and repair yards were upgraded in 2015, increasing its annual production capacity. This aimed to make it capable of taking the lead in the field of shipbuilding and repair in the Mediterranean Sea.

Training and reconnaissance aircraft

The Air Force has developed a training aircraft that combines training, reconnaissance, and armed reconnaissance. The same aircraft is also capable of carrying out operational tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

Fire control system for armoured vehicles, tanks

The Arab International Optical Company, affiliated with the National Service Projects Authority, announced the fire control system for armoured vehicles and tanks.

It is a 100% Egyptian-designed and manufactured system. It is a digital integrated system that makes it easy to modify or add other features, according to the requirements of implementing operational tasks.

The digital fire control computer takes into account several factors such as the distance to the target projectile, and other air effects. The ballistic computer is considered a platform to compensate for the factors affecting the projectile’s motion. It works by calculating the factors and makes the aiming correct automatically to ensure reaching the target.

Sina 200

The Egyptian Ministry of Military Production produced the first three “Sina 200” vehicles. These vehicles are a strong addition to the Egyptian Army’s arsenal, as they were designed and developed entirely in Egypt, in addition to their advanced features.

The idea of designing and implementing the armoured vehicle was implemented in accordance with the directives of President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, who requested the development of armoured vehicles to suit advanced operational uses.

The Sina 200 vehicle is characterised by a high level of protection, as it is classified as level 4 according to the STANAG 4579 standards. It is also equipped with protection against mines, and an additional net can be installed on its sides to provide additional protection against rocket-propelled grenades. It is also a platform for launching missiles, used in electronic warfare, command and control, and ammunition carrier.

New anti-drone device

The Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI) has launched the DJ-400V anti-drone jamming device that is mounted on vehicles.

This device was designed in response to the increasing threats posed by small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These aircraft are widely used in both civilian and military fields, making the development of effective solutions to address their threats essential.

The DJ-400V works to neutralise the threats posed by small and ultra-small aircraft by disabling their data link and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. This capability is essential to mitigate the risks posed by these aircraft in various environments. It can also be customised in accordance with the requirements of the users.

The DJ-400V jamming device works effectively within a range using an undirected antenna. This feature allows it to secure a circle with a diametre of 4 km, providing strong defence against drone attacks from all directions. The DJ-400V is designed to operate in all weather conditions.

It works by jamming to disrupt the communication between the drone and its remote control device. These devices can also control those drones by disabling and jamming them through different frequencies. The high-quality electromagnetic pulse generation system is one of the achievements of pure Egyptian minds and works on a vehicle carrying an anti-drone system.

South Korean K-9 howitzer

The Egyptian Armed Forces displayed the South Korean K-9 howitzer at the EDEX 2023 exhibition. The K-9 is a self-propelled howitzer that was manufactured in Egypt in co-operation with Hanwha Defence, South Korea. The howitser is named “Thunder” and is a 155mm calibre gun. The gun is characterised by its ability to withstand the effects of heavy artillery fire and chemical and biological attacks.
