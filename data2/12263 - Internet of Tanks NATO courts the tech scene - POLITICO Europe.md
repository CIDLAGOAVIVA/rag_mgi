Where once innovations like the internet, the microwave and even duct tape came from within the military and found broader use with the public, today it's the tech industry that is leading the way in transferring technology from homes, work floors and factories back onto the battlefield. Big brands in consumer and enterprise tech like Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft are ramping up their efforts on dual-use technology.

The internet was created by the military but the tech firms that sprung from it have overtaken armies as "the drivers of innovation,” said Warren Low, an official of NATO’s Allied Command Transformation. "It’s now flipped around where the industries are innovating.”

Tech firms recently played a critical — and public — role in supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. After Russian tanks invaded the country in February 2022, tech companies were quickly pulled into the conflict. Elon Musk's Starlink offered satellite internet solutions. AWS helped the government remove essential data from Ukraine. Microsoft and Google helped the country fight a deluge of cyberattacks. Many others followed, providing threat intelligence and safe communications.

The war in Ukraine means “there's an appetite now” to invest in the world of defensive security, said David van Weel, NATO’s assistant secretary-general for Emerging Security Challenges.

Venturing into military tech comes with risks for the technology sector. Google and Amazon both faced internal uproar in past years, with staffers openly protesting projects like Project Maven and Project Nimbus for defense services in the U.S. and Israel. Others, like Apple, have treaded carefully with projects in the defense space. At the United Nations, governments have been working on rules to curtail the proliferation of artificial intelligence-powered weapons and killer robots, debating red lines for industry developments of next-generation warfare.

But increasing demand and potentially massive profits have still spurred tech firms small and large to adapt services to cater to the defense market.
