The Accelerated Training in Defense Manufacturing program (ATDM) in Danville, Virginia, provides training in high-demand skills that lead to well-paying jobs with military suppliers.

During this four-month program, students earn credentials to work in trades that bolster the U.S. defense industry, such as additive manufacturing, CNC machining, non-destructive testing, quality control inspection (metrology) and welding.

Defense manufacturing jobs offer a thriving new career path. ATDM offers not just a solution, but a promising path forward in the transition to civilian life. A shining example of the program’s success is Virginia National Guard Veteran Jacob Lease, who worked in construction for four years after his service. But as a Veteran, he still wanted to support the military in some capacity. He found his answer at ATDM.

Lease chose the additive manufacturing program because of the advanced technological training available at ATDM and the growing job market for that field.

“The full scholarships covering tuition and housing available for Veterans at ATDM allowed me to be fully immersed in my experience and absorb and learn so much in a very short amount of time,” Lease said. “All of the facilities there are top of the line; I couldn’t ask for more.”

The Veteran support at ATDM allowed Lease to earn his certifications and qualifications for his new career at no cost to him or his family.

Before graduation, Lease was offered employment from his cohort this spring and now works as a CNC machinist at Curtiss-Wright in South Carolina, directly applying all of his training from his time at ATDM.

“I love everything about it, because I know everything I’m producing is directly supporting the Navy,” he said. “It’s quite an honor to be able to do that.”
