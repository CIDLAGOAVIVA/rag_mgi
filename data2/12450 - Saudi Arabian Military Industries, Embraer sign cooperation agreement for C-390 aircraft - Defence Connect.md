State-owned defence company Saudi Arabian Military Industries has signed a memorandum of understanding with Brazilian multinational aerospace corporation Embraer to establish cooperation in aerospace, defence, and security industries.

The agreement, a first step in the collaboration of the two countries’ aerospace industry, is expected to expand the operational footprint of both companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and promote C-390 Millennium military transport aircraft to the Kingdom’s Ministry of Defense.

SAMI and Embraer will work to establish comprehensive maintenance capability for the Embraer aircraft in Saudi Arabia, as well as explore mission system integration, a regional maintenance, repair, and overhaul hub and a final assembly line for the Embraer C-390 in Saudi Arabia.

The C-390 Millennium twin-engine aircraft are designed for transport of cargo and troops for medical evacuation, search and rescue, humanitarian search and rescue, aerial refuelling, aerial firefighting, and humanitarian assistance. The aircraft is already in service with the Brazilian Air Force and Portuguese Air Force, with additional orders for the Austrian Air Force, Czech Air Force, and Hungarian Air Force.

Additionally, both companies will engage in training activities and support efforts to achieve the Saudi Vision 2030 goal of the localisation of the defence sector in the country.

“We are delighted to have signed this agreement with Embraer, bringing new support and production facilities into the kingdom,” according to SAMI chief executive officer Engineer Walid A Abukhaled.

“This growth in our business scope and capabilities highlights SAMI’s dedication to advancing and supporting the development of the aerospace ecosystem in the Kingdom.

“It is another important step in SAMI’s efforts in supporting the Saudi Vision 2030 to strengthen the kingdom’s self-sufficiency in the defence sector and contribution to the localisation of 50 per cent of the defence spending in the kingdom by 2030.

“While this expansion of our MRO capabilities is important, the key to this agreement is the establishment of joint training activities, to support the development of Saudi talents and the transfer of valuable skills within the aerospace sector.”

Embraer defence and security chief executive officer and president Bosco da Costa Junior said the company is very pleased to have secured the agreement with SAMI.

“This is the first step to advance cooperation in defence and security involving production chains between the two countries.

“With this memorandum of understanding, Embraer advances further into a strategic market. We will work hard to add value to the local industry, to the Royal Saudi Air Force, and to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”
