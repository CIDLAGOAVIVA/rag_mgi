## 1. Introduction

At the nanoscale, which pertains to the atomic or molecular level, materials  are  purposefully  designed  and  engineered  in  the  realm  of nanotechnology. This field allows for the  development of  innovative materials, tools, and systems that exhibit enhanced capabilities due to their manipulation of structures and particles at an extremely minute scale  [1].  A  nanoparticle  is  defined  as  a  structure  that  experiences confinement in all three dimensions: x, y, and z. Conversely, when a structure  is  confined  to  only  two  dimensions,  it  takes  the  form  of  a nanowire or nanorod. Although a thin film has the ability to stretch over long distances in the x and y directions, its confinement remains limited to  the  z-direction.  When  it  comes  to  analysis  and  characterization, particles are commonly treated as spheres or rods, despite their crystalline structure often leading to multifaceted shapes. Classification of structures can be based on the number of dimensions in which their size is  restricted  [2].  It  could  revolutionize  a  number  of  fields,  including environmental  science,  electronics,  medicine,  and  energy,  providing answers to urgent problems and creating new opportunities for scientific research and technological development [3].

Semiconductors are substances with characteristics halfway between conductivity and insulativity [4 -6]. As the basis for semiconductor devices like transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits, they are essential to modern electronics [7]. Semiconductors are crucial for the manipulation and processing of information in electronic devices because they have the capacity to control the flow of electrical current [8]. The electrical conductivity of semiconductors can be changed by doping them with impurities, which enables the development of sophisticated electronic components that power the modern digital world we live in Ref. [9]. Table  1  presents  a  summary  of  the  characteristics  exhibited  by

## semiconductors.

Nanomaterials play a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion and  storage  applications  due  to  their  unique  properties,  such  as increased surface area and efficient mass [11], heat [12], and charge transfer  [13].  In  terms  of  energy  applications,  semiconductor  nanoparticles have demonstrated promise in solar cells and harvesting industries [14]. To  provide efficient and  environmentally  friendly alternatives to silicon-based solar cells, these materials can also be used to generate hydrogen [15]. Additionally, metal nanoparticles have the ability to substantially alter the optical characteristics of semiconductor nanoparticles  [16].  Moreover,  The  Metal-Assisted  Chemical  Etching (MACE) technique involves utilizing metal nanoparticles to induce pore formation  in  silicon  [17].  The  Seebeck  effect,  which  turns  heat  into electricity, is also demonstrated by semiconductor-based thermoelectric materials [18], and there are opportunities to improve performance by adding nanostructures and dopants [19]. Plethora of semiconducting nanoparticles showcasing advanced applications in Table 2.

Nanoparticles ' distinctive characteristics and uses add novelty to the semiconductor  industry  [32].  Nanoparticles  provide  improved  functionalities  and  capabilities  in  semiconductor  production  due  to  their nanoscale dimensions. They are used as dopants for controlled electrical properties and in processes like chemical mechanical planarization for precise  polishing  [33].  Nanoparticles  called  quantum  dots  enable size-dependent emission and tunable bandgaps, revolutionizing optoelectronic devices and display technologies [34]. Nanoparticles are also used in printed electronics, which makes it possible to create flexible circuits [35]. Overall, nanoparticles open up new avenues for advancement  and  novel  possibilities  in  semiconductor  technology, improving performance and opening the door for further developments. Despite of so many advances, nanoparticles ' potential impacts on the environment  and  the  well-being  of  human  beings  must  be  carefully considered, and strong safety measures must be taken. To fully utilize nanoparticles in semiconductor applications and ensure their secure and long-term  integration  into  future  technologies,  it  will  be  essential  to overcome these obstacles [36].

In conclusion, we need further research and development to overcome these obstacles and ensure successful implementation, recognizing the promising role of nanoparticles to shape the future of semiconductors applications.

## 2. Importance of semiconductor

Gadgets such as mobile phones, radios, televisions, computers, video games, and medical diagnostic apparatus, which are a vital aspect of our lives,  rely  on  semiconductors  for  their  functioning.  Without  semiconductors, these electronic devices would not be possible [37]. Semiconductor lasers with delayed feedback have proven to be well-suited for solving challenging and time-consuming tasks in photonic reservoir computing.  In  this  technique,  the  reservoir  is  frequently  optically injected with the input data [38]. Semiconductor helps electronics work by controlling the flow of electricity. In telecommunications equipment and systems, network and communication chips are semiconductor integrated  circuits  (IC)  [39].  A  variety  of  technologies  are  utilized  in networking and communications chips, with a semiconductor material serving as the vital link between the conductor and the insulator. This material plays a crucial role in controlling and directing the flow of electricity  within  electronic  devices  and  equipment.  Consequently,  it finds extensive application in electronic chips used for solid-state storage, computing components, and various other electronic devices [40]. As AI and machine learning enter and develop inside the banking industry, semiconductor chips assist banks even more. This wasn t a pri-' mary concern in the past because most attacks used software that was vulnerable to remote hacking [41,42].

Insulin  pumps  are  now  both  wireless  and  tubeless  thanks  to

N. Hossain et al.

semiconductors. Additionally, they include detection technology that enables insulin pump to pinpoint to precise moment at which our body requires  additional  insulin.  Insulin  pumps  are  now  using  polymer semiconductor [43].

An LED, an acronym for light-emitting diode, operates as a semiconductor that facilitates the flow of electric current in a single direction. It is designed as a p-n junction diode, as depicted in Fig. 1, with an abundance of electrons residing in the n-type atoms and electron holes present  in  the  p-type  atoms.  When  an  electric  current  is  applied,  it pushes the atoms towards the junction, causing the n-type and p-type atoms to come close together. Consequently, the excess electrons from the  n-type  atoms  are  transferred  or ' donated ' to  the  p-type  atoms, resulting  in  the  accumulation  of  negative  charge  on  the  n-side.  This accumulation initiates a current that moves from the negatively charged region to the positively charged region, known as  forward bias. ' ' At the same time, as the extra electrons from the n-type material pass through the holes in the p-type material, they release energy in the form of light, known as photons [44]. LEDs demonstrate significant distinctions when compared to conventional light sources such a lamps, neon lamps, and gas  discharge  lamps.  They  possess  the  ability  to  illuminate  swiftly, making  them  advantageous  for  battery-operated  or  energy-efficient devices. Moreover, LEDs generate a greater amount of light per Watt in comparison to incandescent bulbs [45] (see Fig. 2).

With the introduction of semiconductors, automotive manufacturers now have the capability to utilize electronically controlled systems in place of manual ones [48]. Thanks to advancements in electrical systems, engineers have successfully developed automobiles that demonstrate  improved  efficiency,  decreased  reliance  on  oil,  and  reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Semiconductor device fabrication, also referred to as the manufacturing process of semiconductor devices, involves the creation of integrated circuits (ICs) such as computer processors,  microcontrollers,  and  memory  chips  like  NAND  flash  and DRAM. These ICs are commonly found in various electrical and electronic devices [49]. It is also crucial to note that NPs exhibit distinct and frequently better physico-chemical properties than the corresponding bulk substance [50].

## 3. Advances of semiconductor applications

Semiconductor nanomaterials exhibit distinct properties and functionalities  that  set  them  apart  from  bulk  and  molecular  materials, highlighting their unique characteristics. These include narrow emission spectra, continuous absorption bands, high stability, processability, and surface  functionalities.  The  synthesis  of  semiconductor  nanoparticles has seen significant advancements in the field of  nanochemistry ' ' [51]. The spatial quantum confinement effect is responsible for notable alterations in the optical characteristics of semiconductor nanomaterials. These materials possess remarkable physical and chemical properties,

coupled  with  a  high  degree  of  dispersity,  making  them  subjects  of extensive research and application in diverse fields. Electron and hole movement within these  materials  is  influenced  by  quantum  confinement, while the size and shape of the materials impact the transport properties of phonons (vibrational modes) and photons (light particles) [52].

In the 1960s, the initial semiconductor heterostructures were successfully synthesized, and they swiftly found applications in optoelectronic  devices  and  fast-response  electronics  [53].  Subsequently,  the development of nanostructures emerged, enabling the confinement of charge carriers in different dimensions. This confinement occurred in one dimension (quantum wells), two dimensions (quantum wires), and three dimensions (quantum dots), resulting in the quantization of energy states. The presence of a collection of nanostructures exhibits distinct properties related to transportation, electrical behavior, optical characteristics, absorption abilities, and other factors, which are intricately influenced by their size and shape. The need to precisely control the growth of nanostructures, with desired sizes, densities, and shapes, has become increasingly urgent due to the complex relationship between the physical properties of particles and their geometry [53].

In  1972, Fujishima and Honda made a significant discovery indicating that the presence of sunlight can trigger the decomposition of hydrogen in water when a TiO2 electrode is exposed to it [54]. Due to its direct conversion of solar energy to readily storable hydrogen and lack of environmental contamination, photocatalysis has since garnered a lot of attention.

A  vast  market  for  the  internet  and  wireless  communication  was created at the start of the twenty-first century as semiconductor process technology advanced from the sub-micron generation to the nano-era and product design underwent revolutionary advancement. The semiconductor industry s technical innovation had an impact on both the ' demand for the product as well as the supply side (production and cost). The  performance  of  semiconductor  companies  is  now  significantly influenced by technical innovation, which is also of interest to investors, particularly institutional investors. However, very few valuation studies have been conducted on the investment value of technical innovation, primarily due to the difficulty of measuring the performance (or capability) of technical innovation [55].

The composition and crystal structure of semiconductor materials allow for the engineering of optical properties [56]. Electrocatalysis is highly  correlated  with  the  type  of  semiconductor  catalyst;  specially, n-type catalysts favor cathodic reactions like the hydrogen evolution reaction,  and  bipolar  catalyst  typically  carry  out  both  anodic  and cathodic reactions [57]. In solar energy conversion applications, and in-depth  understanding  of  the  photocatalytic  mechanism  for  hollow semiconductor photocatalysts formation may offer fresh perspectives on

N. Hossain et al.

how to create high-performance hollow photocatalysts [58].

The  exceptional  properties  of  semiconductor  nanomaterials  have garnered  significant  attention  and  enthusiasm  in  a  multitude  of advanced technologies. These include nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, miniaturized sensors, energy conversion, non-linear optics, detectors, imaging devices, quantum applications, solar cells, catalysis, photography, water treatment, and biomedicine.

increase  the  efficiency  of  the  conversion  of  heat  into  electricity,  researchers frequently use materials with intricate nanostructures or add dopants [69]. On the other hand, high thermoelectric efficiency semiconductor materials are preferred for thermoelectric cooling applications [70]. Electrical, thermal, and figure of merit of the semiconductor material are just a few examples of the variables that affect how well TECs  cool  [71].  Better  thermoelectric  performance  is  indicated  by  a higher ZT value [72].

## 3.1. Semiconductor application in energy

Nanomaterials offer significant advantages that play a critical role in improving  energy  conversion  and  storage  applications. One  key advantage is their ability to facilitate physical interactions or chemical reactions at the surface or interface, which greatly impacts their effectiveness. The specific surface area, surface energy, and surface chemistry are particularly important factors that strongly influence energy-related processes. These factors affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of reactions taking place at the interface, as well as the initiation and growth of phase transitions. Moreover, the smaller size of nanomaterials allows for  more  efficient  transfer  of  mass,  heat,  and  charge,  while  also  accommodating dimensional changes that occur during certain chemical reactions and phase transitions. However, despite their numerous benefits, the integration of nanomaterials into energy conversion and storage systems presents unique challenges. For example, the large specific surface area can lead to increased charge recombination in photovoltaics [59], while the presence of smaller pores, especially micropores ( &lt; 2 nm in diameter)may contributes the penetration of electrolyte ions in supercapacitors [60,61].

## 3.1.1. Hydrogen evolution reactions (HER)

Hydrogen, obtained through the photocatalytic splitting of water, offers  a  safe  and  environmentally  friendly  alternative  energy  source capable  of  mitigating  the  detrimental  impacts  of  fossil  fuels.  This emerging technique utilizes photocatalysts to facilitate hydrogen production,  harnessing  the  omnipresent  resource  of  water  while  being activated by solar energy. The resultant catalysts yield eco-friendly byproducts  and  are  required  to  possess  chemical  stability,  corrosion resistance, and the ability to absorb radiation within the visible spectrum for efficient energy generation [62]. The performance of transition metal  dichalcogenides  (TMDCs)  as  electrocatalysts  for  the  hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is hindered by limited active reaction sites and relatively  low  electrical  conductivity.  This  applies  to  TMDCs  such as MoS2 and WS2 [63].

## 3.1.2. Applications in solar cells

Semiconductor nanoparticles possess favorable qualities that present a promising substitute for silicon-based solar cells. These characteristics encompass  affordability,  an  adjustable  band  gap,  the  capacity  to generate multiple electron-hole pairs, a heightened optical absorption coefficient,  and  the  quantum size effect. Among the diverse array of binary metal chalcogenides, such as PbS, PbSe, CdS, CdSe, and Ag2S, solar  cells  incorporating  these  materials  have  garnered  considerable interest. This is primarily due to their ability to efficiently absorb light within the desirable band gap range of 1.1 -1.4 eV [64].

## 3.1.3. Thermoelectric energy conversion

Semiconductors are essential in thermoelectric energy conversion, which uses the Seebeck effect to directly convert heat into electricity [65].  The  Seebeck  effect  occurs  in  certain  materials,  including  semiconductors, and causes a voltage to be generated across the material when a temperature gradient is applied to it [66]. This phenomenon enables  the  use  of  semiconductor-based  thermoelectric  materials  in thermoelectric  generators  (TEGs)  and  thermoelectric  coolers  (TECs) [67]. TEGs work best with semiconductors that have good thermoelectric  properties,  such  as  high  electrical  conductivity  and  low  thermal conductivity [68]. In order to boost the thermoelectric performance and

## 3.1.4. Energy storage

Semiconductors,  unlike  batteries  and  capacitors,  are  not  directly used for energy storage [73]. Instead, they are utilized in energy conversion  procedures  that  are  sometimes  connected  to  energy  storage [74].  Their  contribution  to  grid  integration  and  energy  conversion technologies is essential for efficiently utilizing and managing energy storage systems [75]. Semiconductors help maximize the effectiveness of energy storage solutions and contribute to a more dependable and sustainable energy infrastructure by enabling efficient energy conversion [76].

## 3.2. Quantum applications

When it comes to quantum applications, semiconductor qubits are incredibly adaptable and cover a complete ecosystem. This is especially true when considering quantum simulation, sensing, computation, and communication [77]. For practical applications in sustainable reuse, a photocatalyst s  stability  is  crucial.  The  stability  and  repeatability  of ' semiconductor-based  catalysts  are  typically  explored  by  the  use  of recycle  experiments,  in  which  the  photocatalysts  are  gathered  and repeatedly  employed  for  specific  photocatalytic  reactions  [78].  Industries involved in the production of semiconductor integrated circuits employ intricate procedures such as wire bonding, wafer back grinding, sawing, die attachment, trimming, encapsulation, electroplating, forming,  and  marking  [79].  Samsung  Electronics  overtakes  Intel  as  the leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips with sales of 75.85 billion US dollars whereas, Intel remained in 69.8 billion US dollar sales income. As of right now, semiconductor technology has integrated 100.8 million transistors at a node size of under 10 nm [80].

## 3.3. Water treatment

Photocatalytic  water  splitting  presents  an  alternative  strategy  for tackling  resource  and  environmental  challenges,  offering  a  hopeful avenue for producing clean and sustainable energy. The emergence of novel  catalysts  utilizing  semiconductor  nanoparticles  has  garnered growing interest due to their ability to facilitate all the necessary reactions for achieving ' artificial photosynthesis ' [81]. The subsequent successful oxidation of CN to OCN by Frank and Bard using TiO2 as a photocatalyst encouraged and accelerated the use of photocatalysts in wastewater treatment [82]. Researchers have written numerous great assessments  as  photocatalytic  technology  continues  to  advance.  For instance,  Wang et al.  discussed  how nitrogen  doping can be  used to change oxide photocatalysts in order to enhance their photocatalytic performance [83]. When a photocatalyst and light collaborate, they give rise to a chemical process referred to as a photocatalytic reaction. This particular approach boasts numerous advantages, such as the absence of secondary pollution, complete degradation of pollutants, and the promotion of environmental preservation [84 -88].

## 3.4. Semiconductor application in biomedical

In recent years, 2D nanomaterials beyond graphene (2D NBG) have emerged as a fascinating class of materials with exceptional antibacterial  properties, surpassing even the renowned graphene. These nanomaterials  comprise  a  diverse  range  of  compounds,  including  Twodimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), g-C3N4,

N. Hossain et al.

transition  metallic  oxides  (CaO,  MgO,  etc.),  black  phosphorus  (BP), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and transition metal carbides and nitrides. Their effectiveness in various biomedical applications, such as anticancer,  antimicrobial,  and  antiviral  treatments,  has  garnered  significant attention. The key factors influencing their performance in these applications include size, morphology, crystal orientation, concentration in the growth medium, stability, and surface functionalization [89, 90]. Given  these  unique  attributes,  2D  NBG  nanomaterials  hold tremendous  promise  as  cutting-edge  tools  for  advancing  biomedical research and healthcare technologies.

## 3.4.1. Antibacterial agents

By employing a non-invasive and targeted approach, the photoinduced antibacterial mechanism demonstrates a treatment method with minimal to no adverse effects. This method involves the activation of photoresponsive semiconductors upon exposure to light energy, leading to the stimulation of fluorophores. Consequently, these fluorophores are transformed into either heat or reactive oxygen species (ROS), which effectively  combat  bacterial  organisms.  Within  this  context,  MoS2 nanosheets exhibit remarkable photothermal efficiency in the near infrared  range,  making  them  highly  promising  agents  for  photothermal antibacterial purposes [89]. By subjecting ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles to  ultraviolet  radiation,  pathogenic  bacteria  can  be  destroyed  [91]. Their  safety  and  multifunctionality  have  led  to  their  recognition  as antimicrobial  agents  suitable  for  various  applications.  Due  to  their biocompatible properties, nanoparticles have demonstrated utility not only in the realm of drugs and pharmaceuticals but also in various other fields such as cosmetics, food packaging, and wound healing [92].

## 3.4.2. Anticancer behavior

The  nonspecificity  of  drug  action  in  cancer  chemotherapy  is increasingly posing challenges due to the occurrence of transformational or decompositional behaviors during the transportation of metal-based drugs into the cell membrane [93]. Developed are non-classical metallodrug-functionalized nanostructures, which demonstrate diverse mechanisms  for  damaging  cell  DNA  and  inducing  tumor  cell  death. Among the essential semiconductor nanoparticles for cancer diagnosis and therapy, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) hold significant importance. They possess multifunctional properties, primarily attributed to their magnetic and harmless characteristics, biocompatibility, stability, and  affordability  [94].  Selective  drug  delivery,  magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic separation techniques, magnetic fluid hyperthermia and thermoablation, as well as biosensing methods are among the various biomedical applications of IONPs [95].

## 3.5. Semiconductor application in sensing

Effective monitoring and control are indispensable for a wide range of  natural  and  human  endeavors.  These  encompass  diverse activities such as forest fires, explosives handling, petroleum and metal refining, mining waste management, vehicle emissions control, natural gas utilization, plastic waste management, coal utilization, the combustion of fossil fuels, and the production processes involved in both food and industrial manufacturing [96]. These activities, which play a vital role in our  daily  lives,  unfortunately  also  generate  substantial  quantities  of pollutants.  Additionally,  it  is  important  to  note  that  volcanoes  also contribute  to  this  environmental  pollution  [96].  Environmental  concerns  have  made  sensing  an  essential  component  of  environmental studies, enabling the detection of hazards in our surroundings. Essentially, a sensor is an electronically fabricated device that exhibits surface changes  upon  stimulation  by  chemical  agents  [97].  Detection  and monitoring of hazardous chemicals, noxious gases, gas detection systems,  temperature  variations,  water  and  soil  contaminants,  and  the well-being of individuals, can be achieved through the use of chemical sensors.

Semiconducting metal oxide sensors, including ZnO [98], SnO2 [99],

WO3 [100], CuO [101,102], Fe2O3 [103], In2O3 [104,105], CdO [106], TeO2  [107], and MoO3  [108], have been widely employed among the various  gas  sensor  options.  Zinc  oxide  nanostructures  with  various shapes and structures have been extensively researched and utilized in the  field  of  gas  sensing  applications,  such  as  nanorods  [109 -118], nanowires  [119,120],  nanofibers  [121],  nanolines  [122],  nanobelts [123], nanoneedles [124], nanoprism [125], nanotubes [126], nano/microflowers [127,128], quantum dots [129 131], -nanoparticles [132 134],  nanofilms,  sheets,  and  plates  [135 --137],  nano/microspheres [138], nanopyramids [139], and nanotetrapods [140]. These substances  exhibit  notable  characteristics  such  as  elevated  electron mobility,  a  lack  of  toxicity,  a  large  surface  area  per  unit  mass,  and exceptional stability in both chemical and thermal environments [141, 142] under operating conditions.

## 3.6. Semiconductor application in electronics

Semiconductors possess easily regulated properties, rendering them highly valuable in the realm of electronics. Their ubiquitous presence extends to a wide array of commercial products, spanning from family cars to pocket calculators. The extensive utilization of semiconductor devices  encompasses diverse industries, including  computers  production, communications,  aerospace,  manufacturing,  agriculture,  and healthcare. By enabling more compact, cost-effective, rapid, and more reliable electronic devices such as music players, LED TV, DVD players, laptops,  and  mobile  phones,  semiconductors  have  revolutionized  the field.  Additionally,  semiconductors  play  a  pivotal  role  in  scientific research and industrial operations [143].

## 4. Semiconductor manufacturing process

One of the biggest industries  in  the  world  now  is  the  electronics sector. The production of integrated circuits is a crucial component of this sector. On silicon wafers, integrated circuits are manufactured in the semiconductor industry. Historically, cost-cutting measures have included shrinking chip size, expanding wafer size, and raising yield while  also  attempting  to  enhance  operating  procedures  inside  semiconductor manufacturing systems [144]. Integrated circuit (IC) usage has been rising quickly and will probably keep doing so in the near future. As a result, the production of semiconductors remains a hot topic in the world of manufacturing [145].

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a crucial planarization step in the production of semiconductors. CMP is being used more frequently in the manufacture of semiconductors for devices with a high level of integration. Recently, the environmental impact of the CMP process was evaluated due to interest in the environment worldwide [146]. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) removes material by combining mechanical and chemical forces [147,148]. When compared to other planarization  techniques,  CMP  has  the  greatest  planarization  length,  which makes it crucial for device production even if it contains particles that can kill by deflecting or scratching. The surface of the chemically softened material is mechanically removed is the primary working principle of the CMP process [149,150]. Three words best describe the future of CMP technology: growth, digitization, and sustainability. Starting with highly integrated circuits, 3D microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), fan-out panel level packaging (FOPLP), and substrates that are free from defects, its use is becoming more and more diverse. In the near future, CMP will be able to remove more than 40 different types of materials and  develop  solutions  for  every  type  of  substance.  Additionally,  the electrochemical processes within the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) technology are anticipated to be used not only in the traditional domains of semiconductors and displays, but also in others like maskless electrochemical texturing [151,152].

The move from 200 mm to 300 mm wafers has begun in the semiconductor industry in an effort to increase manufacturing productivity and lower manufacturing costs [153]. As wafers move through a wafer

fabrication facility (fab), a considerable amount of data is automatically generated. This data encompasses a wide range of valuable information, including details about the manufacturing processes, historical data for each  lot,  tool  profiles,  and  the  outcomes  of  wafer  acceptance  tests. Semiconductor manufacturing is very complex and consists of hundreds of process steps [154]. Fig. 3 shows us those important steps.

## 4.1. Wafer lithography

grinding, slicing the ingots into wafers, beveling, lapping and etching, heat treatment, polishing, thorough cleaning with ultra-pure water, inspection, packaging, and finally, shipping. As a result, the entire process has become progressively more intricate and sophisticated [156]. The general  semiconductor  wafer  fabrication  process  flow  is  depicted  in Fig. 4 [157]. Once the wafer fabrication process is complete, the wafers undergo a probe test to examine their electrical distributions and yield before being forwarded for assembly and final testing [158 -164] (see Fig. 5).

A lithographymethod for processing a semiconductor wafer is provided. The method involves the following steps: extracting liquid from the wafer s surface, eliminating a part of the oxide film from the wafer s ' ' surface, and introducing an oxidizing gas. Notably, the oxidizing gas flow and/or the surrounding gas affected by the oxidizing gas possess an unsaturated vapor pressure of the liquid, resulting in the vaporization of the liquid present on the surface [155]. The creation of wafers, which are mostly constructed from silicon substrates, is the first step in the fabrication of semiconductors. The successful creation of VLSI products, particularly processor chips, relies heavily on the impeccable chemical purity  and  nearly  flawless  crystalline  characteristics  of  wafers.  The production of  silicon  wafers  involves  a  multitude  of  intricate  stages, such  as  refining  raw  materials,  growing  silicon  ingots,  peripheral

## 4.2. Thermal oxidation

Thermal oxidation can be utilized to produce various metal oxide nanostructures, such as nanowires, nanoneedles, and nanoflakes, on the surface of bulk metals, which is a straightforward approach. Compared to chemical-based techniques, it offers several advantages, such as the ability to conveniently and rapidly produce metal oxide nanostructures on a large scale, all without the need for hazardous chemicals [166]. In the presence of air, a range of metal substrates, including foils, foam, wires,  plates,  and  grids,  are  subjected  to  direct  heating  at  temperaturesranging from 300 ◦ C to 800 ◦ C [167]. The mechanism of CuO nanowire  growth  during  thermal  oxidation  has  been  a  subject  of

extensive  research,  aiming  to  unravel  its  intricacies.  One  proposed explanation  for  the  formation  of  CuO  nanowires  involves  the  rapid diffusion of Cu ions across grain boundaries or defects present in the underlying Cu2O layer [168].

Zhang et al. provided an explanation and summary of the schematic representation in Fig. 3. According to their findings, the process can be divided into three main steps. Firstly, at a lower temperature of 250  C, a ◦ porous and defective layer of Cu2O is formed due to compressive stress at the interface. Secondly, as the temperature is further raised to 300  C, ◦ a thin layer of cupric oxide grains is generated. Lastly, nanowires grow on the cupric oxide nanograins through the migration of Cu atoms along grain boundaries driven by stress. These copper atoms incorporate into the cupric oxide nanograins through surface diffusion and react with oxygen  molecules  in  the  environment,  acting  as  a  precursor  for  the growth of cupric oxide nanowires. Importantly, surface diffusion takes place as a result of the difference in concentration of Cu ions between grain boundaries and the root-tip of the nanowire. As nanowire formation initiates, copper ions diffuse along the sidewalls, react with oxygen molecules at the tip, and become part of the existing nanowire structure, leading to the increased length and density of the nanowires with longer growth durations [169 -171].

## 4.3. Photolithography

A  silicon  wafer  can  be  written  with  a  circuit  pattern  using  the photolithography technique. One of the trickiest procedures in semiconductor fabrication is photolithography. The procedure is made up of several associated steps, including photoresist coating, light exposure, and development [172].

Photolithography is utilized to print circuit patterns onto the wafer, with the initial step involving the application of photo-resist onto the wafer s surface. Prior to being exposed, the wafer undergoes a process ' wherein it is transferred to an aligner or stepper machine. Following this, the wafer is subjected to baking, which serves the purpose of solidifying  the  photo-resist  and  enhancing  its  adherence  to  the  wafer [173]. The photolithography process consists of several distinct stages, which include applying a layer of photoresist, coating with an adhesion promoter, performing pre and post baking, exposing to light, and finally, developing  the  exposed  material.  A ' photoresist, ' a  photosensitive substance, is applied to the wafer.

After that, the wafer coated with photoresist undergoes a pre-baking process between 90 and 120 ◦ Celsius to solidify the link between the photoresist and remove any extra photoresist solvent. The photoresist is subjected to a pattern of strong light after prebaking. UV light is often used in optical lithography. To set the pattern before development, a post-exposure  bake  is  carried  out  at  60  to  120 ◦ C.  The  developer,  a substance that can dissolve either irradiated or non-irradiated photoresist, is next applied to the photoresist layer [174].

<!-- image -->

There  are  two  options  available  for  Photolithography:  one  can choose to use either positive resist or negative resist. In the positive resist  method  in  Fig.  6,  a  metal  film  is  deposited,  followed  by  spin coating the sample with photoresist, exposure to light through a mask, development, etching of metal areas, and removal of the photoresist. The  negative  resist  process  in  Fig.  7  involves  direct  deposition  of photoresist,  exposure,  development,  metal  filling  void  areas,  andremoval of residual resist [175].

## 4.4. Etching

Etching, a critically important step, is involved in the removal of material and plays a vital role in the overall manufacturing process (see Fig.  8)  [176].  A  highly  regulated  layer-by-layer  material  removal

procedure is called atomic layer etching [177]. The semiconductor industry has been fabricating electronic circuits since the 1970s using a pattern-transfer methodology that is very similar to the early art form. The patterns are only now 100,000 times smaller thanks to a wafer fab equipment market worth well over $40 billion annually. With today s ' technology, we may deposit different thin films in place of beeswax, use ultraviolet light to print patterns rather than needles that can be held in the hand, and use plasma to etch into the target material as opposed to an acid bath. With modern plasma sources and control systems, plasma etch has improved greatly during the last 40 years.

In technology nodes where dimensions are smaller than 10 nm, the

<!-- image -->

industry  is  increasingly  dependent  on  etching  processes  to  precisely define the shape, sharpness, and accuracy of features [178]. The kinetics of the surface reaction(s) or the mass transport of reactants or products in solution are two key factors that can affect how quickly the semiconductor is etched. The etch rate won t be affected by the character-' istics of the surface, such as its shape or crystallographic orientation, if the surface reaction is quick. Instead, the etching process will be governed by the hydrodynamic characteristics of the system [179].

## 4.4.1. Thermal etching

Thermal  etching  is  a  procedure  that  activates  neutral  gases  with thermal energy. It is also known as vapor etching or gas phase etching. Therefore, thermal isotropic atomic layer engineering is a thermal procedure that necessitates a  prior  modification  step  in  order  to  permit thermal etching [180].

## 4.4.2. Plasma etching

Scientific  and  industrial  applications  of  plasma  are  numerous. ' ' Plasma etching '' is frequently referred to as '' RIE ″ as well. Plasma can be conceptualized as a gas that is partially ionized, consisting of electrons, ions, neutral particles, excited particles, and photons that arise from collisions between electrons and neutral particles, resulting in their energization. Plasma abides by gas laws and, in many ways, acts like a gas. Plasmas were created using a variety of energy inputs, and these plasmas  are  used  to  categorize  plasmas.  The  most  widely  employed plasmas in industry are radio-frequency (RF) plasma and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) [181]. Plasma etching differs from traditional wet etching because it combines chemical and physical etching in a synergistic way. The reactive species disseminated from plasma are adsorbed on the surfaces of the materials/substrates during plasma etching [182].

## 4.4.3. Dry etching

Anisotropy is the main benefit of dry etching over other etching. Understanding the range of directionality that can be obtained with dry etching  techniques  is  essential.  To  achieve  the  desired  effects,  dry etching uses a mixture of chemical and physical elements. The physical component  is  slow  but  anisotropic  nature,  while  the  chemical  etch component is quick but isotropic. Finding the ideal etching method that balances the physical and chemical components is therefore necessary [183].

## 4.5. Deposition and ion implementation

A crucial stage in a wide range of contemporary technologies is the control of how a material s surface layers behave. One can readily refer ' to the outer few microns of a material as the ' surface layer, ' thus one might briefly list the applications where surface qualities are important to understand the issues. The electrically interesting zones are nearly always found close to the surface, making semiconductor devices the most advantageous of these [184]. To enhance comprehension of the

fabrication process, refer to Fig. 9, which depicts a schematic illustration.  In  this  process,  silicon  and  magnesium  ions  are  implanted  by employing a Si 3 N 4 mask that has been patterned using electron beam lithography [185].

## 5. Use of nanoparticle in semiconductor application

## 4.6. Metal wiring

The technique of connecting semiconductor substrates with a metal line is known as ' metallization. ' The metal line holds the ions in the metal together. These metal ions have a stronger electrostatic attraction than any potential antagonistic force [186]. Fig. 10 is a depiction of the metallization  layers  found  in  contemporary  semiconductor  devices [187].

## 4.7. EDS

The  assessment  and  analysis of material microstructure hold immense  significance, particularly when  conducted  using  energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) within a scanning electron microscope.  This  method,  known  as  electron-excited  X-ray  microanalysis, plays a crucial role in evaluating and understanding the intricate details of materials at a microscopic level [188]. The pioneering utilization of lithium-compensated silicon (Si(Li)-EDS) marked the advent of the first functional  energy-dispersive  X-ray  spectrometer  (EDS).  This  groundbreaking development took place in the 1960s, when semiconductor-based  X-ray  detection  was  introduced.  The  Si(Li)-EDS was  successfully  operated  on  an  electron-column  device  known  as EPMA (Electron Probe MicroAnalyzer) [189].

For a clearer comprehension of the schematic representation of the semiconductor  production  process,  including  the  EDS  rest,  refer  to Fig. 11 [190]. Before sending the wafer to the next stage, a variety of machines are utilized in the EDS test to carry out numerous operations, ensuring the reliability of the functioning chips. The flow of materials during  the  steps  can  adopt  either  a  circular  or  linear  configuration [191].

## 4.8. Packaging

When a material s size approaches the nanoscale and its surface atom ' content  increases  significantly,  the  properties  of  the  materials  alter. Compared to bulk materials smaller than 1 mm, there are fewer atoms at the  surface  in  bulk  materials  [193].  In  many  processes  involved  in producing semiconductors, nanoparticles are essential. The following are a few applications for nanoparticles.

## 5.1. Nanoparticles made of semiconducting materials

Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are crystalline particles with dimensions on the nanometer scale with between 100 and 10,000 atoms. Chemical synthesis allows for their creation as almost spherical nanoparticles  (quantum  dots,  quantum  rods,  or  nanostructures  of  various types) with practically atomic precision. Tetrapods are an example of more complex forms [194]. Semiconductor nanocrystals combine the optical and electrical properties of semiconductors with the mechanical, chemical, and physical features of molecules. As a direct result of the confinement of electrons at the quantum level and its impact on the electronic states, their color is extremely controllable. Such nanocrystals are a type of ' artificial atom ' that could be used as parts of upcoming nanoelectronic devices or in optoelectronic systems, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells [195].

The complex physics of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as well as  their  enormous potential for use in photonics and quantum information technology have captured the attention of numerous researchers all over  the  world.  QDs  are  three-dimensional  structures  with  a nanometer-scale that contain electrons and holes in dimensions equal to their corresponding De Broglie wavelengths [196].

Quantum dots (QDs), which are semiconducting nanoparticles, hold great  promise  as  advanced  materials  in  various  fields  due  to  their nanoscale dimensions and customizable properties for specific applications.  These  applications  include  nonlinear  optical  devices  (NLO), electro-optical devices,  and  computing  applications.  Overall,  QDs represent a highly encouraging class of zero-dimensional materials. The creation of nanocomposites, which might be viewed as a 21st-century scientific revolution, is made possible by the joining of QDs to polymers [197].

The main objectives of chip packaging revolve around safeguarding individual chips from physical damage, establishing a protective layer to shield  against  moisture  and  chemical  contaminants,  ensuring  robust connections between each chip and an electrical circuit through sturdy leads,  and  facilitating  the  dissipation  of  heat  generated  during  chip operation. Electric circuits are shielded from scoring or heat punctures by protective layers made of materials like plastic and ceramic that are used to encapsulate the chip [192].

## 5.2. Thin-film deposition

Since the majority of the deposition procedures used to make thin films possess a non-equilibrium characteristic, the metallurgical phase diagram does not prevent the creation of thin films, giving thin films unique  benefits  over  bulk  materials  [198].  In  order  to  meet  the increasing requirements of industries for versatile and highly responsive

materials,  the  deposition  process  is  considered  a  crucial  factor  in creating innovative thin film materials. The fabrication of these materials  heavily  relies  on  the  deposition  procedures,  as  they  determine nearly all of the properties exhibited by thin films [199]. As transparent conductors find applications in various devices such as LCD watches, computer  displays,  car  defrosters,  antireflection  coatings  for  camera lenses, and other common items, thin film materials are everywhere. Fiber  optic  cables  for  communication  coatings for  architectural  glass that  are  both  colorful  and  energy-efficient.  solar  panels  ornamental finishes on plastics used in toys and car parts a plethora of electronic and optical equipment. Durable coatings for drill bits, bearings, and cutting instruments even metallic finishes inside potato chip packets to maintain crispness! Our way of life would be significantly different without thin films. And the application of thin film technologies will only grow in popularity [200].

## 6. Nanoparticles usage in semiconductor production

## 6.1. Gold nanoparticles

Considerable  scientific  investigation  has  been  dedicated  to  structuring  porous  electrodes  with  large  surface  areas  for  the  purpose  of photoelectrochemical applications. A significant portion of this research has  specifically  concentrated  on  exploring  the  potential  of  semiconductor  nanoparticles  [201].  In  one  case,  however,  an  Au  nanoparticle  multilayer  architecture  was  utilized  in  the  fabrication  of  a photoelectrochemical apparatus [202]. A complex structure consisting of  multiple  layers  of  gold  nanoparticles  was  constructed  on  an  ITO support using a gradual crosslinking process. This process involved the interaction between citrate-capped gold nanoparticles and a bis-bipyridinium  ZnII-protoporphyrin  IX  dyad  7,  which  served  as  an electrostatic crosslinker. The presence of the light-responsive porphyrin was confirmed through the absorption spectrum of the structure, while the coverage of gold nanoparticles and the crosslinker was verified using cyclic  voltammetry.  When  the  porphyrin  component  was  exposed  to light,  electron  transfer  occurred  towards  the  pendant  bipyridinium groups [203].

## 6.2. Silver nanoparticles

Silver  nanoparticle  suspensions  are  created  through  a  chemical reduction process involving Ag NO 3, formaldehyde reductant, stabilizer in the form of PVP, and organic bases as reaction promoters. Triethylamine and pyridine, two distinct chemical bases with varying basicities, were utilized in the reaction. The more basic triethylamine was used to create silver particles with diameters between 20 and 30 nm. Smaller (10 20 nm) particles were produced from the less basic pyridine. Both -processes produce silver nanoparticle solutions that are devoid of metal ions and acceptable for usage in the semiconductor sector. By ink-jet printing, the suspensions will be employed to create microinterconnects  for  integrated  circuits  (IC)  devices  [204].  Due  to  their distinct optical properties that depend on size and form, gold and silver colloidal nanoparticles have undergone extensive research [205].

## 6.3. Copper nanoparticles

The considerable research focus on copper nanoparticles stems from their  promising  prospects  across  various  industries,  such  as  biology, electronics, and optics. These nanoparticles, derived from copper, have garnered  significant  interest  and  have  found  applications  in  diverse fields. They have been utilized for catalysis, conductive film production, lubrication, nanofluid development, and as antibacterial agents, showcasing the wide range of potential uses for copper-based nanostructured materials [206]. Photolithography techniques can be used to pattern semiconductors using copper nanoparticles. To speed up the synthesis of photoresists  or  resist  materials,  they  can  function  as  a  catalyst  or  a sensitizing agent. Due to this, high-resolution patterns can be created during  lithography  procedures,  aiding  in  the  downsizing  of  semiconductor devices [207].

## 7. Advantages of nanoparticles in semiconductor

Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) not only have remarkable qualities, but they also have the huge benefit of being simple to alter the properties of materials. TMDs come in a variety of varieties, and the majority of them share crystal structures and lattice constants. By fusing two or more different types of materials with varying proportions of the components, it is possible to continuously control the material s prop-' erties. For instance, an alloy with a continuously tunable bandgap can produce  a  wide  spectrum  response,  which  hasmore  use  in  optoelectronics [208 -216].

B P  is  another  two-Dimensional  semiconductor  material  that  has -received much study in addition to TMDs. B -P is essentially an allotrope of  phosphorus (P) and resembles graphene and TMDs in terms of its layered  structure.  B -P  has  a  lot  of  remarkable  qualities,  including  a direct bandgap, strong carrier mobility, and good in-plane anisotropy, which gives it a lot of potential for use in electronics [217 -222].

TMOs,  alongside  various  other  types  of  two-dimensional  semiconductor  materials,  form  a  notworthy  category  of  materials.  These substances have a simple synthesis process, strong chemical stability, and great mobility. Most significantly, these materials typically have a wide bandgap. This gives them a significant edge in some particular situations, such UV PDs [223].

Nano-semiconductor materials of the one-dimensional (1D) variety, such as ZnO, III-V, and other semiconductor nanowires (NWs), exhibit diameters that can span from a few to several hundred nanometers. In contrast, their lengths are not restricted and have the potential to extend even to tens or hundreds of microns [224]. It is used for solid-state energy conversion, harvesting and also for storage applications.

The  structural,  electrical,  and  optical  characteristics  are  quite distinct from those of typical materials. 1D semiconductor materials can now be employed in photovoltaic applications like diodes, PDs, and the like thanks to their novel and exceptional characteristics. 1D materials offer excellent properties and are simple to integrate, which bodes well for their future in research. GaAs NWs, for instance, have a significant deal of potential in optoelectronic applications due to their inclusion in III-V compounds, adequate direct bandgap, and excellent photoelectric

conversion efficiency. Another form of 1D material that is extensively employed  in  the  realm  of  optoelectronics,  such  as  PDs,  is  the  V-VI semiconductor nanowire [224].

B P serves a variety of purposes as a two-dimensional semiconductor -material  with  good  characteristics.  However,  2D  B -P  cannot  be employed effectively in several unique circumstances. Later, 0D nanodots (B -P QDs) and 1D B -P NBs were created. Ultrafine and ultra-small nanosheets  that  have  been  removed  from  bulk  B -P  crystals  are commonly referred to as BPQDs. BPQDs can be prepared using a variety of techniques,  including electrochemical  exfoliation, solvothermal treatment, and others [225,226].

## 8. Current challenges &amp; future opportunities

reagents  and  solvents.  Semiconductor  nanomaterials  possess  properties like a large surface-to-volume ratio, stability, reactivity, and conductivity, which enable their applications in various emerging technologies such as energy conversion, nanoelectronics, solar cells, and biomedicine. Wide band gap semiconductors, like GaN and InGaN, find applications in energy generation, wireless communications, and power electronics due to their advantages in terms of performance, efficiency, and  high-temperature  control.  The  surface  functionality  of  semiconductor  materials  has  improved  sensing  applications  in  areas  like pollution monitoring, biosensing, and food safety. By applying nanotechnology principles, there is potential for further advancements and extensive applications of semiconductor materials, warranting further research in this area [236].

## 8.1. Challenges

Despite  the  numerous  advantages  of  diode  laser  absorption  spectroscopy,  its  implementation  in  industrial  process  control  remains limited. The primary reasons for this are the intricate nature of existing instruments and the lack of readily accessible high-quality, high-power diode  lasers  specifically  designed  for  the  required  spectral  ranges.  A major drawback in utilizing laboratory prototype spectrometers for industrial purposes is the limited suitability of currently available lasers for continuous operation [227].

The  advancement  of  optical  fibers  featuring  crystalline semiconductor  cores  within  glass  claddings  holds  immense  potential  for various  captivating  device  applications.  Traditionally,  semiconductor crystals are fabricated using different methods such as the Czochralski, Bridgeman, and epitaxial techniques. However, in all cases, the growth process is sluggish and the resulting crystal size is often limited in scope [228].

Application of graphene in the field of electronic devices is challenging due to its zero bandgap properties. However, a variety of other 2D materials have developed quickly as a result of the novelty of these layered  materials  and  a  few  unique  properties  (different  from  bulk materials). TMDs, which are semiconductors, are frequently utilized in the field of electronics due to their electrical qualities and extensively tunable bandgap. For instance, MoS2 has a smaller subthreshold swing (SS)  value,  a  larger  on/off  ratio,  and  relatively  high  carrier  mobility [229 232]. -

Before the advent of silicon-based chips, computers took the form of sizable  devices  equipped  with  tubes  and dials.  These  early machines demanded  significant  amounts  of  electricity,  making  them  not  only cumbersome but also vulnerable due to their remarkable yet delicate nature  [233].  The  worldwide  chip  market  experienced  yet  another round of pricing increases in 2021 as a result of COVID-19. One explanation  is  that  the  pandemic  disrupts  the  flow  of  raw  materials.  The second reason is that as modern manufacturing techniques become more complex,  they  also  become  more  expensive  [234].  Monitoring  the Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Process  Using  Adaptive  Substatistical PCA Companies may be more interested in monitoring semiconductor manufacturing if they employ the PCA(MPCA) approach. The goal of statistical process control is to enhance the speed and accuracy of the process that must be used to identify process irregularities and identify their root causes [235].

## 8.2. Future opportunities

The scientific community has shown great interest in the realm of semiconductor nanomaterials, primarily because of their capacity for chemical  customization  and  the  capability  to  transform  them  into quantum dots. Methods such as ultrasonication, microwave, and solvothermal techniques have been explored for preparing colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals that are evenly distributed. Nevertheless, in the context of biomedical applications, biosynthetic approaches are preferred for their safety and the use of less harmful or non-harmful

## 9. Conclusion

The use of nanoparticles in semiconductor applications has advanced the field significantly and created new opportunities. With their ability to enable precise control and improved performance, nanoparticles have proven valuable in a number of crucial processes, including chemical mechanical  planarization,  thin-film  deposition,  and  semiconductor nanocrystals. With their tunable bandgaps and size-dependent emission, quantum  dots  have  completely  changed  optoelectronic  devices  and display technologies. To fully realize the potential of nanoparticles in semiconductors,  however,  issues  like  synthesis  control,  integration, dependability, and safety must be resolved. In order to overcome these difficulties and guarantee the successful incorporation of nanoparticles into  upcoming  semiconductor  technologies,  ongoing  research  and development  efforts  are  essential.  The  continued  development  and application of nanoparticles in semiconductor applications holds great promise for the future, spurring innovation and reshaping the electronic industry.
