Team: Talent and collaboration are expected to be the backbone of the ecosystem

The team is defined as not just the leadership team and employees, but also the relationships that can shape the ecosystem in ways that inform policies, mitigate market risks, and increase supply chain agility. Relationships will be important in lining up funding, ensuring technology transfer, and providing supply chain visibility. Customers, whether individuals or fleet companies, can be critical in driving acceptance of AAM and potentially influencing demand trends.

The right talent and leadership can help AAM OEMs scale to meet future demand

Following type certification, AAM OEMs could potentially transition from startup size to mid size to handle commercialization and early operations. To meet broad demand, these OEMs will likely then become large-scale companies for volume manufacturing.

Along this journey, it is also important to have the right talent, with advanced technical skills, to meet manufacturing quality requirements. To ensure the highest standards of safety and quality, AAM OEMs are likely to manufacture aircraft through a heavy reliance on digital technologies. OEMs may, therefore, look for talent to handle digital technologies like model-based systems engineering and other new technologies such as 3D printing. These new digital skills would sit on top of employee experience in aerospace or automobile manufacturing.

Having a strong board (i.e., founders, executives, and investors) can also drive companies from prototype to low-rate initial production. To completely scale from postcertification to full-scale production, OEMs should find experienced talent for critical managerial roles (i.e., the C-suite). AAM OEMs are already recruiting from aviation administrations and big aerospace and automobile companies.16

However, the aerospace and defense industry is still facing talent shortages. The introduction of AAM has the potential to intensify competition for highly skilled jobs within an already competitive landscape. To address this, the AAM industry may need to collaborate with institutions or work with investors to develop local talent for manufacturing and operating AAM aircraft. AAM companies should also focus on attracting a diverse workforce to drive product development and better understand the nuances of communities to drive public acceptance.

AAM OEMs can leverage relationships and collaboration to scale up aircraft manufacturing

Regulatory bodies are working to ensure the development of robust aircraft, manufacturing plants, and infrastructure. They will set the standards for manufacturing, pilot certification, vertiport design, and integration into existing airspace and transportation networks. To scale at speed and navigate evolving regulations, AAM OEMs should collaborate with these regulatory bodies. Collaboration throughout the product development phase can help information exchange and, thus, speed up the certification process.

For instance, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) “regulate[s] aviation safety and the efficient use of the airspace by aircraft.”17 In the United States, AAM OEMs should engage the FAA to understand how evolving regulations may impact their value proposition. Currently, the FAA is collaborating with NASA to review the existing regulations to enable the development of new entrants, including AAM.18 This can help OEMs develop technical knowledge and optimize designs to align with future regulations.

Further, the AAM ecosystem has benefited from relationships with traditional aerospace companies, automotive companies, technology companies, and significant funding partners. This cross-industry collaboration can leverage the strength of each company to scale up AAM aircraft manufacturing and operational capabilities. One US AAM OEM is working with aerospace suppliers for eVTOL aircraft components.19 This is expected to streamline manufacturing and the assembly process to enable high throughput production.

Similarly, working with established aerospace and automotive companies can be beneficial for AAM manufacturers as they try to produce at scale in a highly regulated environment. Archer is working with Stellantis as a contract manufacturer to mass produce eVTOL aircraft. This relationship is intended to contribute to the advanced manufacturing technology, experience, talent, and capital that can be essential for the growth of aircraft manufacturing.20

Automotive companies can assist the AAM industry in adopting production technologies and supply chain strategies to achieve manufacturing at scale. Traditional aerospace companies can help AAM OEMs meet regulatory requirements, obtain type certification, attract investments, establish a robust supply chain, and build confidence in the market.

AAM OEMs may explore new approaches to get closer to the customer

AAM companies will likely rely on infrastructure owners and operators to reach the average commuter. These entities are expected to be responsible for integrating vertiports into their transportation infrastructure portfolios. AAM companies may need to work closely with them to ensure that proper infrastructure is available to support AAM operations.

Further, OEMs may forward integrate into air taxi and charter services.21 For AAM OEMs, owning and operating the fleet, or even franchising it, might provide significant value. Such ownership would likely allow AAM companies to be more proactive in defining and shaping the AAM ecosystem.

Technology: Using strategies and technologies to get from parts to products

An eVTOL aircraft requires far fewer critical parts for manufacturing as compared to its traditional engine counterpart. Additionally, as compared to traditional aircraft, eVTOL aircraft are simpler to build, maintain, and service, and often faster to produce.22

Building a resilient supply chain for scaling AAM aircraft manufacturing

As AAM OEMs near production-ready prototypes, they should seek to maximize supply chain agility and resilience. Agility can allow OEMs to optimize cost and scale, while resilience can allow OEMs to withstand unforeseen circumstances (for example, supply chain interruptions due to geopolitical tensions). They may do this through a diversified supply chain and address critical parts and components (e.g., batteries for eVTOL aircraft). This can be especially important for critical material and critical component sourcing.

Being part of a nascent industry, AAM OEMs have an opportunity to build greenfield manufacturing plants and engage existing facilities across the supply chain. This could allow AAM OEMs to avoid the hassle associated with brownfield retooling and start right from factories of the future. The greenfield plants may also provide an opportunity to leverage known process improvement techniques and digital capabilities and could remove organizational and operational bottlenecks.

Standard parts and processes plus digital technologies can streamline operations and reduce costs

Globally, there are more than 900 eVTOL designs and concepts.23 As AAM OEMs settle on design concepts, they will likely find value in standardizing their processes and parts to move from engineering or limited production to full-scale production. Standardization may help avoid a fragmented supply chain and reduce the cost of manufacturing parts and components. Standardized assembly processes can lead to shorter production times, and standardized parts can be sourced from multiple suppliers. Standardization could also address key aspects such as safety and reliability to help ensure that the highest standards are maintained. Further, standardizing parts and components can make it easier to train maintenance technicians and operators. The AAM industry could benefit from embracing standardized manufacturing practices to facilitate the scaling of production and operational processes.

Digital technologies will likely allow companies to both realize cost reductions and ensure high quality standards. AAM manufacturers offering cost-effective aircraft can drive more aircraft into operation, potentially resulting in less operational cost and enabling competitive pricing for passengers. As companies grow, the systems that support manufacturers during their developmental phase may not be suitable or scalable for high-volume production.

During scaling, companies often face challenges in optimizing or removing bottlenecks such as smoothing the engineering-to-production information exchange. Model-based systems engineering approaches, used in conjunction with digital twin technology, can help AAM OEMs optimize this interface. Digital twins and digital prototyping24 can expedite the testing and iterative design process, achieving cost savings and faster development of new products and services compared to traditional approaches. Those manufacturers who adopt digital twins could realize a 30% reduction in time to market for new products and services.25

While traditional manufacturing processes may not pose significant challenges during the proof-of-concept stage, adopting a smart manufacturing ecosystem can help make plants connected, optimized, transparent, proactive, and agile for full-scale production. With the rise of smart factories, AAM companies can create first-of-a-kind systems at both speed and scale. Converging operational technology and information technology systems employed by smart factories can monitor and enhance the quality of manufactured parts and components. These digitally enabled factories can collect and offer data to help ensure high quality standards are met, while supporting expedited qualification and certification processes at scale. These factories can help bring products to market in a shortened timeframe.

The AAM industry can scale smart factory initiatives at four levels, starting from maximizing the performance of a single asset to ultimately connecting manufacturing sites, supply chain, and product development cycle in real time (figure 2). AAM OEMs likely have an opportunity to optimize both process principles and smart manufacturing capabilities with production assets at the shop floor level, extending seamlessly to the entire factory network. The smart manufacturing capabilities could also help AAM manufacturers with product customization and demand flexibility without incurring excessive costs. Even though OEMs may have to spend more dollars in establishing smart manufacturing plants, they could recognize more benefits in the long run.
