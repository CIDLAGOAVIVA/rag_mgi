On December 1, the Polish Armament Agency signed a contract worth USD 2.6 billion with South Korea's Hanwha Defense. This deal includes the acquisition of 6 self-propelled howitzers of the K9 family, specifically the K9A1 variant, in 2025, and an additional 146 K9PL self-propelled howitzers in 2026-2027.

The agreement also encompasses a comprehensive training and logistics package, as well as a substantial stockpile of 155 mm caliber ammunition, totaling tens of thousands of rounds. The logistics package includes a reserve of spare parts, replacements, and operational materials, along with equipment needed for the howitzers’ maintenance.

Furthermore, as part of a technology transfer, technical documentation will be shared, establishing industrial potential for the military and industry. This includes maintenance, repair, modernization, and the production of selected structural elements of the howitzer by Polish defense industry entities. These measures aim to quickly achieve the operational capabilities required by the Polish Armed Forces in the coming years, by equipping them with modern military hardware.

On July 27, 2022, a framework agreement was signed with Hanwha Defense, targeting the acquisition of a total of 672 K9A1 and K9PL self-propelled howitzers. This package also includes training and logistics, ammunition stock, and manufacturer’s technical support.

The training package covers simulator equipment and personnel training in Poland, as well as ongoing service support since the arrival of the first K9A1 self-propelled howitzers. The agreement also stipulates a technology transfer, leading to the maintenance and development of existing industrial capabilities in the field of barrel artillery technology. This transfer will enable service competencies in the first phase and ultimately initiate the production of K9PL howitzers in Poland, thus localizing the supply chains for spare parts.
