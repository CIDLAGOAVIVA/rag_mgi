The Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and its Forward Defense program have stood up the Commission on Software-Defined Warfare to digitally transform the armed forces for success in future battlefields.

Co-chaired by 27th US Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper, Former Acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Christine Fox, and President of Purdue University Mung Chiang and comprised of a distinguished group of subject-matter and industry commissioners, the Commission will develop a framework to enhance US and allied forces through emergent digital capabilities.

Near-peer US competitors, China and Russia, are recognizing and adapting to a paradigm shift in modern technology that can potentially alter existing military balances of power.
