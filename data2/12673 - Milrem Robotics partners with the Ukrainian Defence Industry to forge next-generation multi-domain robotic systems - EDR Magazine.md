December 7th, 2023 – Europe’s leading robotics and autonomous systems developer Milrem Robotics and the Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI) which consolidates national defence industry companies signed an agreement to start forging next-generation multi-domain robotic defence systems.

The agreement, signed during the First Defense Industries Forum (DFNC1) in Kyiv, details several development and manufacturing activities between Milrem Robotics and the members of UDI.

As a first step, the parties will start strategic cooperation in identifying Ukraine’s requirements and use cases for robotic systems which can enhance the capabilities of Ukraine’s armed units in the ongoing war and after the war.

Thereafter the companies involved will integrate Ukraine’s battlefield experience into Milrem Robotics’ existing robotic and autonomous systems and develop new products to create Ukraine’s manned and unmanned multi-domain capabilities.

“This unfortunate war in Ukraine has made it clear that unmanned and robotic systems have an important role on battlefield and this role will increase in time,” said Kuldar Väärsi, CEO of Milrem Robotics. “The main goal is to protect the troops and to keep the warfighters safe, but at the same time provide stronger and an asymmetric effect on the aggressor’s forces. We are honoured to cooperate with UDI to develop and manufacture robotic systems which help Ukraine win this war.”

“The First International Defence Industries Forum proved that we are on the same course as our Western partners, as Ukrainian manufacturers signed an agreement with Milrem Robotics and other global arms companies. Currently, Ukraine is gaining unique experience in Defense Tech, and we are ready to share this knowledge with our partners. We aim to deepen our cooperation with leading high-tech international companies to build the arsenal of the free world together,» said Oleksandr Kamyshin, Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine.

Ukrainian defence developers and manufacturers will be included to integrate their defence technology, such as weapon systems, electronic warfare and mine-clearing equipment with Milrem’s robotic vehicles to meet the requirements of the armed forces.

Additionally, the parties will look into manufacturing THeMIS Combat (with HMG and antitank capabilities), Combat Engineering (mine detection and demining), CASEVAC unmanned ground vehicles and other Milrem Robotics’ products in Ukraine and engineering cooperation in designing a wheeled Robotic Combat Vehicle.

Milrem Robotics has already delivered 15 THeMIS Unmanned Ground Vehicles to Ukraine to support logistics, casualty evacuation and route clearance operations.

Milrem Robotics is the leading European robotics and autonomous systems developer and systems integrator, with offices in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the US. The company is known for their THeMIS and Multiscope UGVs, the Type-X Robotic Combat Vehicle and the MIFIK autonomy kit.

UDI, which was transformed into a joint-stock company this summer, is a strategic manufacturer of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine and unites state-owned defence companies employing around 67,000 highly qualified employees.
