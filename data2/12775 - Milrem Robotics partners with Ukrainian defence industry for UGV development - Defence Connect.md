Estonian robotic vehicle manufacturer Milrem Robotics has partnered with the Ukrainian defence industry (UDI) for the development of next-generation multi-domain robotic defence systems.

The robotics supplier, owned by UAE state company EDGE Group, signed the agreement with UDI members at the First Defense Industries Forum in Kyiv on 7 December.

Under the agreement, both parties will begin strategic cooperation in identifying Ukraine’s requirements and use cases for robotic systems to enhance the capabilities of Ukraine’s armed units in the ongoing conflict and after the war.

The parties will also integrate Ukrainian battlefield experience into existing Milrem Robotics robotic and autonomous systems, as well as enhance the development of new products for manned and unmanned multi-domain capabilities.

Milrem Robotics has already delivered 15 THeMIS unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) to Ukraine to support logistics, casualty evacuation and route clearance operations.

“This unfortunate war in Ukraine has made it clear that unmanned and robotic systems have an important role on battlefield, and this role will increase in time,” according to Milrem Robotics chief executive officer Kuldar Väärsi.

“The main goal is to protect the troops and to keep the warfighters safe, but at the same time provide stronger and an asymmetric effect on the aggressor’s forces.

“We are honoured to cooperate with UDI to develop and manufacture robotic systems which help Ukraine win this war.”

Ukrainian defence developers and manufacturers will be included to integrate their defence technology, such as weapon systems, electronic warfare and mine-clearing equipment, with Milrem’s robotic vehicles to meet the requirements of the armed forces.

Additionally, parties will explore manufacturing of heavy machine gun, anti-tank THeMIS Combat, combat engineering (mine detection and demining), CASEVAC unmanned ground vehicles and other Milrem Robotics’ products in Ukraine and engineering cooperation in designing a wheeled robotic combat vehicle.

“The First International Defence Industries Forum proved that we are on the same course as our Western partners, as Ukrainian manufacturers signed an agreement with Milrem Robotics and other global arms companies,” according to Minister of Strategic Industries of Ukraine Oleksandr Kamyshin.

“Currently, Ukraine is gaining unique experience in defence tech, and we are ready to share this knowledge with our partners. We aim to deepen our cooperation with leading high-tech international companies to build the arsenal of the free world together.”

Earlier this week, Milrem Robotics showcased the development of unmanned ground vehicles and robotic combat vehicles to European Union Military Committee chairman General Robert Brieger.

During the tour, company representatives engaged in discussion regarding autonomous and remotely operated defence technology, capabilities and safety of UGV and RCV equipment, as well as the vision and achievements of the company.
