Meeting the challenges of tomorrow’s battlespace requires advanced technology designed for speed, efficiency, and maximum flexibility in order to remain future-proof. With the ability to continuously evolve a fleet without causing significant disruption to mission readiness, overmatch goals can be met, and warfighters can have the necessary, up-to-date equipment at their disposal to keep pace with near-peer adversaries.

To help meet this need, the U.S. government passed Title 10, a law that requires all major defense acquisition programs to be designed and developed using a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). In short, this means that products and systems sold to the U.S. military need to interoperate more seamlessly – even with systems from other vendors and OEMs.

Military and industry leaders recently came together at the MOSA Industry and Government Summit and Expo to discuss the progress being made toward embracing open systems across military programs.

During the Summit, the Modern Battlespace had the opportunity to sit down with the Mosarc team at Collins Aerospace: Jason Kautz, associate director of program management; Jeffry Howington, principal business development manager for military avionics; and Karen McCash, senior marketing manager of military avionics and helicopters.

During our discussion, we asked about the need for open systems in the military, the challenges in adoption, and the progress being made toward MOSA standards across the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and its industry partners.

The Modern Battlespace (TMB): What challenges is the DoD looking to solve with the adoption of open systems in its weapons systems and platforms?

Jason Kautz: The short answer is that they’re looking to make system upgrades, changes, and maintenance faster, better, and more affordable. The Title 10 language very clearly enumerates five or six things that are being pursued across the entire DoD.

“Systems that can’t easily be upgraded or have components changed out are less scalable and adaptable into the future.” — Jason Kautz

This includes competition and access to innovation, significant cost savings and avoidance opportunities for technical upgrades, increased interoperability between different platforms and systems, and other types of sustainment benefits.

They’re pursuing this because, throughout the lifecycle of a given program or platform, 30 to 40 percent of program costs are the upfront procurement. The other 60 to 70 percent of the costs are in the sustainment of that platform over time. They need to reduce these costs and make the sustainment and maintenance of platforms less costly over time.

The DoD is also concerned with maintaining overmatch against near-peer threats and being able to innovate at the speed of relevance. Systems that can’t easily be upgraded or have components changed out are less scalable and adaptable into the future.

TMB: How far have the DoD and its industry partners come in embracing and implementing open systems since the launch of MOSA?

Jeffry Howington: Collins has well over 20 years of utilizing open architectures to provide flexibility to our DoD customers, enabling the ability to upgrade those systems and providing the government with choices regarding how they want to upgrade that system. The government can install or add to that system or have another party outside of Collins Aerospace do that.

For example, our mission flight management software MFMS-1000 is a reusable hardware-independent product that allows for enhancements to be made independent of Collins Aerospace. The MFMS-1000 utilizes core flight management technology that follows Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) civil regulatory guidance allowing us to apply it to multiple programs, including fixed wing, rotary wing, and unmanned aircraft systems, providing them with civil certified RNP RNAV navigation capability. We also provide open interfaces that are certified as conformant to the FACE™ Technical Standard, along with a data model to allow for the independent creation of custom mission-specific modules that interoperate with the software we provide. This makes it easier for the DoD to compete for and put specialized capabilities into the hands of the warfighter quickly..

“As Collins moves forward with MOSA, the defense industry is also moving forward with implementing open systems.” — Jeffry Howington

The DoD in turn is increasingly making their buying decisions based on adherence to MOSA and open systems. In fact, there are several recent and upcoming programs with open systems at the center. Examples include the Tactical Combat Training System Increment II (TCTS II) and the U.S. Navy’s NAVAIR Flight Management Function Program, which has selected our mission flight management software MFMS-1000 product. Open systems are at the center of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program for the U.S. Army, which requires MOSA open standards and architecture.

As Collins moves forward with MOSA, the defense industry is also moving forward with implementing open systems. While some of this enables competition, which is a goal for the government, it also provides us with additional capability in the form of open system components that we can incorporate into our systems. We’ve recently demonstrated the ability to incorporate such components from a dozen other companies into a system that utilize open interfaces for interoperability.

Each of those programs is critical for the U.S. military as it prepares to protect our interests, and each will rely on open systems to ensure they can be upgraded with new capabilities to keep pace with our near-peer adversaries.

TMB: Why would OEMs and defense contractors be reticent to enable an open systems approach?

Jason Kautz: Part of the Title 10 requirement is open, accessible, and verifiable interfaces – which has resulted in numerous discussions about data. The government wants to ensure that they get access to use intellectual property (IP) in a way that reduces vendor-lock and allows for augmentation or replacement of a solution over time.

As a result, the DoD is beginning to issue Request for Proposals (RFPs) that ask for more IP than what is traditionally provided by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) today. This could be seen as a threat to OEMs that want to protect their IP and that have financially benefited from vendor-lock in the past.

“In the past, we’ve had government customers looking to leverage one of our innovations or technologies be unable to do so because they could not get the IP required for integration.” — Jason Kautz

I will say that Collins Aerospace is analyzing what is required by Title 10, and we generally see these requirements as an opportunity to support the industry and our customers.

In the past, we’ve had government customers looking to leverage one of our innovations or technologies be unable to do so because they could not get the IP required for integration. We’ve witnessed OEMs provide excessive non-recurring engineering (NRE) bills, making the solution cost-prohibitive. These requirements will help eliminate these challenges.

TMB: What has impacted the speed of open system implementation and adoption across the Defense Industrial Base Sector (DIB)?

Jason Kautz: Title 10 also requires the definition of modular interface boundaries for technologies and components. This forces a certain modularity at an architecture level to which the company must design or build its product.

Many of the reference architectures that are being developed across the different DoD services and programs are still in their normalizing stage. The services are still receiving industry input to ensure that any reference architecture that is identified can be procured and supported by the DIB.

Rapidly defining reference architectures has been a challenge for the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force. The reference architectures they develop also need to allow for the DIB to innovate so that the architecture is not obsolete by the time it is published and procured.

This creates risk for companies like Collins Aerospace. If they invest money in developing a product and the military establishes modularity boundaries in a different place, they have to invest more to fit that product into the military’s reference architecture schema.

TMB: Collins Aerospace launched a new modular open system approach to avionics at the recent MOSA Summit and Expo called Mosarc. What exactly is Mosarc? What are some of the components of Mosarc?

Karen McCash: Mosarc is essentially Collins Aerospace’s next-generation modular, open-systems approach to avionics. It leverages modern open system technologies, standards, tools, and processes to help serve the markets across commercial and defense programs for current and future fleets.

“Mosarc is essentially a building block that can be applied across various customer needs in the form of solutions that offer a broad spectrum, including software, line-replaceable units (LRUs), and a complete flight deck that can be tailored and customized.” — Karen McCash

The primary objective of Mosarc is to enable rapid and seamless integration of mission avionics with the safe management of civil flight critical functions and mission functionality. This objective is met through open standards for interoperability with products from Collins Aerospace and external vendors.

Mosarc is essentially a building block that can be applied across various customer needs in the form of solutions that offer a broad spectrum, including software, line-replaceable units (LRUs), and a complete flight deck that can be tailored and customized.

TMB: What benefits would Mosarc deliver to the DoD? How will it make aircraft easier to maintain, cheaper to repair, and simpler to update? Will Mosarc stop vendor lock?

Karen McCash: Mosarc provides seamless integration and well-defined interfaces that strictly follow an industry or reference standard or that we have for MOSA. It gives confidence that when an organization selects these third-party capabilities, they reduce their integration risk and realize the benefits of MOSA.

For each Mosarc major system component, all the interface data is accessible through an open architecture IP license. Mosarc will help reduce vendor-lock because we provide increased access to data. We call them, “open architecture IP data rights.” This is not an open-source license, but the license grants broader use and access to the interfaces, whether physical, electrical, data, etc., at a modular interface level.

Jason Kautz: When we developed Mosarc, we focused on ensuring we got the safety-critical foundation correct – this is crucial because providing a seamless interface to the pilot is critical to reducing pilot workload and improving mission effectiveness.

When we developed Mosarc, we leveraged our decades of experience developing avionics, working with open standards, and providing solutions across multiple aircraft types with different mission scenarios. It was important to take advantage of that knowledge and experience to develop a solution that allows for accessibility, becomes seamless for the end user, and maintains or streamlines the certification requirements when components are updated.
