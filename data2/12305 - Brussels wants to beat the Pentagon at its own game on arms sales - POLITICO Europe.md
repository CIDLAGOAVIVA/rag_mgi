Europe doesn't have any equivalent — which puts EU champions like Airbus, Leonardo and Thales at a disadvantage.

The European Commission is trying to figure out how to change that, according to an eight-page consultation paper seen by POLITICO.

“Should an EU equivalent of the U.S. FMS-scheme be considered, building on government-to-government schemes, to support procurement from the [European Defence Technological and Industrial Base] by EU member states and support to partners, including Ukraine?” the document reads. “If so, how should such a mechanism operate?”

In early 2024, Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton is expected to present a European Defence Industrial Strategy to help support the Continent’s European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). The consultation document is one of five papers circulated to national delegations to get their views on what the strategy should look like.

POLITICO previously reported on the first paper, which provides a broad overview of the main issues Brussels wants to tackle on both the supply and the demand sides.

The FMS scheme allows governments to buy directly from Washington without having to go through defense companies and can accelerate deliveries of equipment by drawing on U.S. Department of Defense stocks. According to a study referred to in the Commission paper, 95 percent of European purchases of U.S. kit since the war started have been made through the FMS scheme, for a total value of more than $60 billion.
