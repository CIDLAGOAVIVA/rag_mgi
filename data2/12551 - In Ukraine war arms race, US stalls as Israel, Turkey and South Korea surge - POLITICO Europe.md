Turkey's four largest defense companies saw their 2022 revenues rise by 22 percent to $5.5 billion compared to 2021, with the standout being drone-maker Baykar.

The aggregate arms revenues of the three Israeli companies in the SIPRI ranking reached $12.4 billion in 2022, a 6.5 percent increase compared with 2021.

The combined arms revenues of the four South Korean companies in the ranking fell by 0.9 percent, primarily due to an 8.5 percent drop recorded by the country’s biggest arms producer, Hanwha Aerospace; but South Korean companies are likely to see a surge in revenues this year due to huge orders with Poland and the United Arab Emirates.

Poland, a frontier state with Ukraine, has lodged massive orders with South Korean arms producers for K2 Black Panther tanks, K9 self-propelled howitzers and FA-50 fighter planes (not all of which are yet visible in SIPRI's 2022 data, but should factor in this year). Warsaw traditionally looked to the U.S. for its big arms deals, but turned to South Korea because it was able to fill orders faster than backlogged U.S. companies.

In a signing ceremony last year, Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Błaszczak explained that “unfortunately due to limited industrial capabilities, it will not be possible for the equipment to be delivered in a satisfactory timeframe. Therefore, we started talks with South Korea — our proven partner.”

The three countries are swinging into an early lead because their arms factories are already on war-ready footings.
