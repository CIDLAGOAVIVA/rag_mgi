A year out from a general election, with his opposition Labour Party 19 percentage points ahead of the ruling Conservatives in the polls, Healey is on a mission to make it clear that a Labour government will want the United Kingdom back at the table when it comes to EU defense cooperation.

"If we win the election ... we must rebuild relationships with key allies and with the European Union," Healey said. "Relationships that were badly damaged, sometimes deliberately so, during the Brexit process."

That's a dramatic shift from the Conservatives.

A defense and security treaty that would have formalized U.K.–EU cooperation was included in the political declaration that set out the terms of a post-Brexit relationship, but ex-Prime Minister Boris Johnson killed that offer.

There are still areas of cooperation. The U.K. is part of a defense project under the EU’s sector coordination group — known as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) — on military mobility.

But Healey says a Labour government would look to expand that to include cooperation on logistics projects and cyber-security along with a broader strategic dialogue. "We in the U.K. have particular expertise in military and security intelligence," he said.
