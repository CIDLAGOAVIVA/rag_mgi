Korea and Britain have signed an initial agreement to push for joint defense exports, Seoul's arms procurement agency said Thursday, as the two countries seek to boost security cooperation.

Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) Minister Eom Dong-hwan and Kemi Badenoch, Britain's secretary of state for business and trade, signed a memorandum of understanding in London on Wednesday (local time) as President Yoon Suk Yeol is on a state visit to Britain this week.

Through the MOU, the two sides are expected to jointly seek opportunities for arms industry exports and make efforts to enhance cooperation between their defense companies, according to DAPA.

DAPA also signed a separate statement of intent with Britain's defense ministry to deepen defense cooperation.

It said the signing will pave the way for strengthened cooperation in the arms industry, such as joint research and development efforts and personnel exchange.

The signings came as Yoon and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signed the Downing Street Accord on Wednesday, raising the two countries' security and economic ties to the highest level. (Yonhap)
