San Antonio-based Irys Technologies has acquired government information technology services contractor Diversified Technical Services Inc. for an undisclosed sum as part of efforts to add defense industry customers and expand product offerings and market presence.

DTSI provides software development, cybersecurity and related IT services to customers in defense and government sectors, Irys said Friday.

Beto Altamirano, co-founder and CEO of Irys, said DTSI has developed cybersecurity technologies and other tech offerings in support of the U.S. Air Force and other government agencies for over four decades.

“We work with government and private sector clients across the U.S. and around the globe. Together, we will leverage our combined strengths to expand our market,” added Altamirano.

The combined entity will continue to operate as Irys Technologies with Altamirano serving as chief executive, Eduardo Bravo as chief operating officer, Greg Wickets as vice president of operations and Dave Ramos as VP of corporate affairs.

Beto Gomez, co-founder of Irys, will remain involved and continue to serve as CEO of the nonprofit organization Better Futures Institute.

Irys said it will hire more than 60 employees and maintain its headquarters in Alamo City, Texas.
